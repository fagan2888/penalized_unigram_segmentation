this means that the union ’ s budget should receive more in the way of resources than the paltry 1 % of gdp that a few important countries , beginning with great britain , wish to grant .
the socialist group in the european parliament will judge the presidency on its ability to release a realistic , but more generous , financial perspective .
the december summit must be the summit of renewed solidarity .
it is growth that will create stability , and not the other way round .
thank you very much , mr goebbels .
the debate is heating up , and this is positive in terms of ensuring that more members become involved in it .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i can understand how the high-level relationship therapy at hampton court apparently proceeded as it should .
it took place , however , in duly romantic and exclusive surroundings , so the odds were all on your side .
i therefore have a practical request to make to the presidency and the commission .
we all know of course that this necessary work needs to be carried out by the individual member states .
efforts at reform are an exclusively national matter .
the eu can and must , however , complete the work on creating a fully-fledged internal market for capital and services .
i am convinced that , if this process is a success , it will yield genuine labour market reforms on the basis of the motto , ‘ there is no alternative ’ .
the benefits to the people of such a reform would be huge , and that is of course what eu cooperation is all about : providing our fellow citizens with additional benefits .
i should also like to put a clear question to you , mr straw .
you mention the court of auditors ’ annual report .
i seek a clear answer from you .
. mr straw , mr barroso , i have three remarks to make in response to your speech , mr straw .
why abandon this draft ?
on the subject of the single market , now : i hope that you will agree with me that competition also needs to be fair and balanced .
in other words , the single market is also built on common social standards , and thus forms part of the very spirit of the treaties .
above all – and this will be my final point – we must leave to one side a budgetary debate characterised by an increase in national self-interest .
armed with such a commitment , it will perhaps be possible for us to convince our citizens of the usefulness of european policy .
unfortunately , while the idea of convening the council was not a bad idea , it suffered most in the execution .
unfortunately , instead of agreement prevailing , we again witnessed the customary quarrels break out about as important an issue to the future of europe as the financial perspectives .
i would remind the house that mr blair , during his speech from this same tribune in the european parliament on 23 june , stated that he had always been an enthusiastic champion of europe .
i wonder , four and a half months later , how mr blair is translating these words into practice .
what is the appraisal of his country 's presidency so far , given that one month before it ends we have not reached agreement on the financial perspectives .
the social model has not progressed even one inch and the council 's response to globalisation is the creation of an ambiguous adjustment fund .
the british presidency had the opportunity to write history at hampton court .
the comments after hampton court were from those amazed that nothing happened .
in fact it should be labelled the hampton court ‘ amaze ’ .
the ard tv station in germany said that , after four months , nothing happened – absolutely nothing .
the polish media called it one of the most bizarre eu summits .
in italy , just called it ‘ embarrassed ’ and ‘ embarrassing ’ .
mr blair claimed it debated the things the public wanted it to debate , but the public does not want european policies for universities when the eu has no competence in education .
nor does it want things like nine separate missions around the world as part of an eu defence policy .
if hampton court proved anything , it was that vacuums are dangerous when filled with hot air from politicians .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , to paraphrase your introductory words , mr straw , i am here and i beg to differ .
joking aside , despite mr blair ’ s and mr barroso ’ s welcome good intentions , the practical outcome of the hampton court summit was highly unsatisfactory .
first of all , the long-awaited platform on the commission ’ s european social model seemed rather disappointing .
no real strategy and no targets for a genuine revival of europe ’ s economy were proposed ; instead there was just a policy of damage limitation .
so far there has been nothing concrete behind high-sounding claims such as the ‘ lisbonisation ’ of resources and the globalisation fund .
as for mr blair , the balance of his political account is certainly not in the black .
despite continual outward reassurances , there is in fact no agreement on the financial perspective , which is clearly the crux of the problem .
finally , there is no real intention above all to renew the debate on the united kingdom ’ s unfair rebate .
it is a privilege that has been paid for mainly by italy and france , siphoning off precious resources from our two countries .
mr president , from the spin of today one would think that much had been achieved at hampton court , but as we have already heard , the verdict of the informed eu press was almost universally negative .
one press agency reported that many papers could not recall a more useless and shallow example of posturing with no outcome .
one paper talked of a bizarre show of relaxed leaders who dodged the most crucial issues facing europe .
another called it a summit of impasse with a facade of forced smiles .
in other words , they failed to answer the question .
the eu , the said , is the wrong institutional platform from which to deal with globalisation .
it has become too large and divided .
the appropriate political levels are national governments and the eurozone .
i suggest that the article in the comes close to the truth .
mr president , i am very sorry but i am afraid i have to be a little bit churlish as well .
the summit at hampton court was what i warned it would be : something of a talking shop – or even a talking palace .
and i think that mr straw ’ s speech was as churchill once said ‘ a pudding without a theme ’ .
first the prime minister downgraded the hampton court meeting to one day .
he then constructed an agenda that was thin on specifics and avoided all the major and pressing issues facing the eu and finally , amazingly , he decided there would be no communiqué at the end .
these are hardly the hallmarks of a presidency and prime minister leading the agenda and shaping our future .
i am frankly surprised the presidency has anything at all to report to us from the summit .
at least , however , this parliament is receiving a report , something which the prime minister failed to give the british house of commons in the aftermath of the event .
the informal council was a wasted opportunity .
europe needs direction on economic reform .
instead , the presidency produced a couple of discussion papers written by academics and even these were not discussed .
europe needs direction on reforming the so-called social model .
again all we had were a few worthy but irrelevant discussion papers .
europe needs direction on being more flexible and responsive .
however , the fundamental issue of what to do following the rejection of the constitution was not even on the table for discussion .
europe also needs direction on its future financing .
i agree with mr barroso that the presidency must make efforts to reach an outcome at the december council .
we will be looking carefully to see precisely what is contained there and whether mr blair ditches his previous commitments in protecting the british rebate .
transparency and openness is another issue for the presidency .
recently i called for meetings of the council to be held in public when it is operating in a legislative capacity .
mr blair says he wants progress on this .
i challenge the presidency to implement such a procedure before its term of office ends and i look forward to the council ’ s answer in this matter at question time following this debate .
what about the court of auditors ’ report on the eu accounts ?
for the eleventh year in succession , the court has been unable to give a statement of assurance on the accounts .
this really must be sorted out by the presidency .
drift and indecision have been a fundamental characteristic of the british presidency .
indeed , the prime minister of slovakia speaking on it said ‘ silence reigns , we do not have information ’ .
i must agree with that analysis and , whilst enjoying mr straw ’ s speech today , i cannot see that it takes us anywhere useful at all .
hampton court provided no evidence that the presidency and particularly that the prime minister had any strategy .
he gave every appearance of drifting from summit to summit unable or unwilling to provide the kind of leadership we british conservatives called for in june .
let us hope that the last chance saloon at the forthcoming brussels summit will demonstrate that my disappointment with the british presidency is actually misplaced .
mr president , recently a terrorist suspect wanted by the british government was arrested and extradited from rome in a matter of weeks .
this was a direct result of the european arrest warrant ; previously it could have taken years .
this is just one example of the positive benefits the european union brings to its citizens .
each citizen has benefited from the single market by some eur 6 000 a head in increased output .
it is possible , if you wish , to swim in the sea off blackpool in my region because of european union laws that have improved the environment .
however , we have to ensure that there is follow-up on these matters .
one of the difficulties with the lisbon agenda in particular is that member states themselves promise to deliver but do not .
if that were to happen , the european union could move much further forward without necessarily having any of the grand plans that some people have outlined in this debate .
let us stick to delivering what we agreed to deliver .
that will be the key success of the european union .
i congratulate the president-in-office for the commitment made by this presidency to parliament .
we are delighted at the extent to which ministers have engaged parliament and particularly the extent to which the british home secretary has ensured that parliament is involved in taking forward that security agenda .
that is one of the most important dimensions of where the european union is going in future to protect the interests of its citizens .
mr president , a meeting with little or no purpose , held in pleasant surroundings , under a warm autumn sun : that is what the informal summit at hampton court was .
no practical outcome , no progress , no perspective .
instead of formulating a response , they did what they usually do and trotted out the catalogue of proposals that have been repeated a thousand times over .
yes , the european effort in relation to research and development obviously needs to increase .
yes , centres of excellence at university level are obviously needed .
yes , a common energy policy is obviously needed .
yes , a real immigration policy is obviously needed too .
finally , yes , europe obviously needs a security policy .
we always come back to the same old problems , though .
if we want to do things together , we need political will , we need effective and democratic institutions and we need a common budget .
well , it is clear that , in relation to these three points , nothing has been undertaken , or even attempted , by the uk presidency .
the uk presidency has not only failed to get the union working again , but has also contributed to its decline .
from now on , the uk presidency has clear responsibilities .
mr straw , the december summit will be the last chance to provide europe with a substantial budget and to thus give hope back to all those who believe in europe ’ s future .
mr president , if i may say so , mr president-in-office , the hampton court summit was the biggest embarrassment that any presidency has ever come up with .
far from making progress with the pressing problems of the financial perspective and the debate on the constitution , these items were removed from the agenda .
even its chosen theme of ‘ social europe ’ was one to which the summit found itself unable to do justice .
there was no discussion of any of the policy instruments for a social europe , whether minimum standards , labour legislation or the means whereby unemployment and social exclusion may be done away with .
what you have proposed , mr straw , is particularism , and does nothing to advance the cause of social europe .
instead of action , you offer only ideas ; instead of pro-active measures to address globalisation , you have come up with knee-jerk responses like this idea for an anti-shock fund .
our aim , though , must not be the creation of a backward-looking europe , but rather of a europe that can face the future with confidence .
– it is not enough simply to note that there are social problems in the eu and around the world .
as my group said at the informal meeting held at the end of october , it is crucial that we analyse these problems and change the policies that are at the root of this problem .
as competition is seen as the be-all-and-end-all , precedence is always given to measures aimed at creating competition between workers in order to try to drive salaries and other social benefits further and further down .
hence the emphasis on greater labour flexibility , mobility and support for relocations , which shed jobs and lead to greater unemployment and a more precarious labour market .
what we have heard today follows the same script .
even when people talk of creating a favourable environment for companies , we all know that the companies in question are only the large ones .
this is a trend that must be reversed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i have the impression that the heads of state or government meeting at hampton court were debating in a vacuum .
on the great social , economic and political issues , which have been mentioned in many of the previous speeches , the results achieved were decidedly sparse .
the challenge that the young rioters have set us is , instead , a very serious threat , and one that we should consider carefully when we talk about immigration .
i certainly do not mean to put the blame on those young people , but rather on those who drew up these mistaken policies , those who still talk about immigration in such bureaucratic , general and superficial terms .
we have fallen short in the immigration challenge .
our immigration policies have been a failure for europe , and i consider it our duty to acknowledge the fact and to debate it .
instead we need to address the causes , change our policy and stop making insane decisions , such as making it easy for people to bring in their families or even easier to take up nationality .
in essence , what we need is a sensible immigration policy .
mr president , minister , mr barroso , ladies and gentlemen , the talks held by the heads of state or government at hampton court represent a significant acknowledgment of the difficulties that the european union is currently undergoing .
only europe can respond effectively and guarantee well-being and security for our countries .
a meagre budget will not allow us to address these challenges , but the october european council was an encouraging start .
that is why we are looking to the december summit with moderate optimism .
mr president , i have looked up the word ‘ informal ’ in my french dictionary .
informal , in french , means badly formed and inelegant .
this adjective was used by montaigne in 1580 to describe something that was difficult to define .
i will let you be the judges of the hampton court summit and the ghost of catherine howard .
you have not had much luck in the uk presidency .
france has said no and the united kingdom is being asked to relaunch europe .
i think that is asking a lot .
when i think of our fellow citizens , i have the feeling that lisbon is not fulfilling this role .
today , there is a vacuum .
when it comes down to it , i do not dispute the priorities of the summit : that is not the problem .
the real problem is the connection with the citizens : it is as if there used to be something we shared that has now disappeared .
i think that the next summit or the ones after that should enable us to rediscover a landscape that we can share with our citizens .
that is no good at all .
we are not going to harmonise everything , but it is still possible to make progress in certain areas .
and if we forget to do this , if we neglect this word and this value , the citizens will distance themselves from us .
finally , another topic is close to my heart , that of exchanges between young people .
i have looked at the statistics .
in 2005-2006 , europe is funding 280 000 young people as part of three programmes : comenius , erasmus and leonardo .
however , there are 58 million of them .
multiplying the corresponding budget by 10 would not cost us too much , particularly given that it is on these young people that we must stake european awareness .
mrs riis-jørgensen asked me about the court of auditors and she asked for a yes or no answer .
my apologies , but i have to give a yes and a no because this matter is in the hands of finance ministers , and you know what they are like !
the answer is that the ecofin council on 8 november adopted conclusions listing a range of actions for both the commission and member states .
my judgement is that where member states have control of the money , they ought properly to account for it as well .
if they do not have control of it then the european union will have to account for it , but i am with you on encouraging our finance ministers to get a grip on this .
nevertheless , this is the responsibility of the commission and of this parliament together .
we all have responsibility for this .
colleagues here have been very frank , so i will be frank in return .
my problem with what a number of colleagues have said is that people refer to the need for change and then say that the future for the european union nevertheless lies in the past .
all i can say to colleagues here is that globalisation is a fact of life .
the french , my comrade friend , may not like it , but we either have to deal with it or it will engulf all of us .
i did not invent it , president barroso did not invent it and nor indeed did president chirac , but it is a fact of life .
that means that the old european economic and social model will not work to deliver prosperity , social justice and jobs in the way it used to .
this is a big challenge , especially , if i may say so , for the country you represent , and for a number of others on the continent .
france is a country which knows that , and it is for that reason there is a higher level of evasion in france than in other countries .
france is one of those countries which goes in for saying , as we understand it , that people can be assessed on whether they work 48 hours a contract rather than 48 hours an employer .
this is a fact , and this parliament undermines confidence in its own measures if it turns a blind eye to what is going on when everyone knows that this has happened .
moreover , it is better to be flexible .
there is no european-wide requirement to set a minimum wage , which in my view is a fundamental human right .
there is no requirement on it , however , and it is left to national governments .
the countries that apparently have slightly longer hours actually have a better health and safety record than some other countries , including , my friend , your own .
turning to the important issue of the budget , i listened very carefully to president barroso ’ s speech .
he said that the defining issue of the british presidency will be the financial perspective , which is a test of whether europe is on the move .
it certainly is a test of whether europe is on the move , but we do not regard it as the defining issue .
i think it will be judged on the fact that on 3 october we agreed to start negotiations with croatia and turkey .
that is what will help to shape europe for the future .
i would remind colleagues that the last financial perspective was not agreed until the equivalent of the march council 2006 , rather than the december council 2005 .
we very much hope that we can reach agreement , but it is going to be difficult .
well , mr jonckheer spoke of not allowing this issue to be dominated by national egos .
luxembourg – a country that i like very much – is the richest country in europe but will continue to be a net beneficiary .
if we were in that happy position we would be saying to the presidency : ‘ come on , do a deal ’ .
if the only issue was whether we ended up with eur 3 billion or eur 6 billion in our pockets , that would be easy .
the problem , however , for a number of member states – and not just the united kingdom – is that we have historically been very high contributors .
i am just saying this so that colleagues can understand the problem we have within the united kingdom .
we might as well lay our cards on the table and be frank .
however , the uk has still paid eur 39 billion , which in population terms is much more than those other two countries .
spain has benefited by eur 48 billion and portugal by eur 14 billion , so that puts a different perspective on things .
i agree that we have all got to pay our way for enlargement .
we see our responsibility as being to the union as well as to our publics .
no one can accuse my prime minister of not being courageous or of not being very committed to this union , as we have done a great deal .
i just wanted to make that clear so that everyone understands the difficulties we all face .
this is not about a minimalist europe , because europe ’ s achievements have been astonishing over the last 60 years when one recalls the condition of conflict which had characterised europe for three centuries prior to that .
that is the european union ’ s achievement .
what we have to do for the future , however , is to build on that achievement and recognise that the challenges are a little different .
one of the areas in which we can do the greatest good , and are doing so with the great leadership of javier solana and the commission , is in the field of foreign , defence and security policy .
take what was agreed yesterday by condoleezza rice and javier solana .
take the fact that the european union is now the third party in that agreement to allow palestinians to travel in and out of gaza and the west bank .
we were not always regarded by the government of israel as the third party in such matters .
take what we are doing together with respect to iran , take the joint declaration we have just agreed with afghanistan and take the tangible increase in aid of africa .
it is here that we can see real progress being made by europe collectively .
this presidency has been a great privilege for us , mr president .
i have certainly enjoyed it , and i look forward to another six weeks of interesting times here in strasbourg , brussels and in other cities .
obviously , the greater the expectations , the greater the subsequent disappointment .
time is running out , results are thin on the ground , and i do not think the uk presidency should be surprised at the criticism that parliament is levelling at it in this debate .
i am not going to set fire to myself in public for the constitution , but i think that the limitation of having six-month presidencies is emerging very clearly .
every presidency in fact inherits the previous presidency ’ s agenda and adds a new layer of commitments , thus increasing the list of decisions to be made and reducing the chapter of decisions adopted .
we continue to add ingredients to the cake , but the cake never leaves the oven .
i should like to mention an example that i put to president barroso yesterday evening .
it is true that europe has been through other severe crises in the past .
i am not nostalgic for the europe of six , nor do i believe there is a golden age to long for .
it seems to me that europe ’ s situation at this point in time , post-enlargement and pre-constitution , resembles the second case much more than the first .
i am not frightened of the institutional crisis , the financial perspective or the lisbon strategy in themselves , but i am afraid that all these elements together may be extremely damaging to the european union .
the uk presidency still has six weeks to bring its work to a close , and i hope it will be able to leave a positive message for tomorrow ’ s europe .
mr president , normally i would complain that one minute is not enough to sum up a presidency in its latter stages , but not in this instance .
uk presidency : no progress .
it is interesting that mr straw commented on the sparse attendance here and made an extremely limp attempt to be humorous about it .
– ladies and gentlemen , i object in principle to the setting up of the so-called globalisation fund as a response to the challenges of globalisation .
there is much to be gained from globalisation , but only in a flexible free market environment in which working is worthwhile .
european policy is often at variance with this idea , inviting citizens to be passive and sometimes even rewarding laziness .
the eu ’ s share of world trade has dwindled over the past 10 years , while that of the united states , and in particular china and india , has skyrocketed .
i am convinced that instead of wrangling over the protectionist globalisation fund , the eu member states should as a matter of urgency reform their labour markets .
putting off such reforms undermines public support for free market policies and creates a breeding ground for nationalism , xenophobia and racism .
mr president , mr alexander , mr barroso , ladies and gentlemen , the european union is facing an identity crisis , a loss of its values and general disillusionment .
for the first time in a long while , europeans are afraid that their children ’ s standard of living is going to be lower than theirs .
how can we react and provide a response to these major worries ?
the hampton court summit claimed to be a stage in these considerations .
europe has been plunged into this crisis because it does not know what it wants .
others have a different vision , a political ambition for europe to be defined by its borders and by its projects , in order to assert itself and to share its humanist values in an unstable world .
any other debate would be nothing but guesswork .
mr president , i would like to raise a point of order , in accordance with rule 65 ( c ) , if i remember correctly .
we have just been listening to the british foreign minister .
i would like , via your presidency , to ask the conference of presidents the following question .
my colleague has just spoken for one minute .
her britannic majesty ’ s minister with responsibility for european affairs is with us .
how can the european parliament allow itself to be limited to just one minute ’ s speaking time to respond to him ?
could you perhaps speak to your colleagues in the conference of presidents , to decide what approach should be taken in future ?
thank you mr beazley , i think we have understood your argument .
it is the political groups that divide up the speaking time .
if they want to give their main speakers 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour , they have the right to do so , and the opposite is also true .
the time taken by the commission and the council is not counted , but both of them , i have observed , are careful not to abuse this .
it has done so through actions and commitments , including practical ones .
what i mean is that , even if we only want to achieve half of those objectives and we want to treat each other fairly , we have to deal thoroughly with the core issues of the crisis .
the only possible way forward now is to design a new institutional architecture and to share policies to an ever greater extent .
mr president , i would be fascinated to know at what stage the british presidency realised that to have adopted as its logo a flight of birds heading towards europe was a mistake !
if the british presidency does not secure a deal on the future budget perspectives , it will not be regarded as a success .
i agree that movement has to be made on the issue of agriculture .
while the british presidency has to recognise that , at some point , it is going to have to compromise , it is also important for other member states to realise that they must give too .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i hope , mr president-in-office of the council , that you are aware of the increasing impatience with your presidency and of the growing sense of disappointment .
your period in office may well not yet be at an end , but most of it is already over .
it is not only tony blair whose absence we regret , but i do wonder whether he had perhaps recognised at last that there is more to a successful presidency of the council than two good speeches .
above all , though , we regret the lack of concrete results , constructive proposals , and serious negotiations with this house in order to resolve problems and hammer out answers to people ’ s questions .
the only way we will create trust is with a new togetherness and sustainable solutions .
let me ask you this : are those really the things that the people of europe see as priorities ?
are those really the issues for the people who have no work , or for the europe that must be made more competitive ?
no , i say , they are not .
perhaps they have their priorities wrong .
declarations of intent alone do not make for a successful presidency .
all six of the points that emerged from hampton court may well be right , but most of them are not things that the european union has the powers to deal with .
let me turn to the financial perspective .
between your proposal and our own there is a difference of eur 70 billion .
between your proposal and the treaty , there is a difference of eur 2 billion .
between your proposal and the commission ’ s , there is a difference of over eur 100 billion .
tell the people what it is that you intend taking away from them before you start pretending to be on their side ...
mr president , the hampton court summit showed that the european union needs fundamental reform .
we have the diagnosis , but european leaders have so far failed to provide the answers .
we know what we should do , but not how these aims can be achieved .
we do not have the resources to do it either .
we cannot have more europe with less money .
agreement has still not been reached on the financial perspective 2007 – 2013 , which could be a disaster for us , the new member states , as we stand to lose two-thirds of our possible financial support .
this is why the financial directive is so important for us .
rather than demolishing these , more community policy should be implemented in other areas .
the big question is how to do all this .
hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsány proposed that , alongside community policies , we should establish coordinated cooperation , which would mean harmonising national policy in the different areas .
this would not mean new community policies , but would help to improve cooperation , be it on energy , be it on research and development .
i call upon mr barroso and the commission : let us help europe heal its current crisis and let us move forward in the area of coordinated cooperation .
mr president , the british are famous for their nerves of steel , their reserve , their calmness , their peculiar sense of humour and also for their emotional self-restraint .
i should like to take this opportunity today to ask mr alexander whether we will hear that he shares these sentiments .
if the 2007-2013 financial perspective is not adopted before the year is out , will you too consider this to be a personal failure , on your part and on the part of prime minister blair ?
tony blair gave a fine speech to the house in brussels in june , and his analysis of the crisis in which europe finds itself was worthy of publication .
unfortunately , during the following months and subsequent ministerial speeches we have heard nothing but increasingly pale repetitions of the prime minister ’ s proposals .
my impression is that the british have lost the will to fight for the realisation of their vision of the european union .
instead , they have decided to muddle through this six-month presidency as best they can .
unfortunately , they too have been infected with the european disease of impotence and paralysis .
europe can only be built by means of effective action and decisions that will be forever writ large in the history of our continent .
the most important task we face today is the financial perspective .
these countries would therefore lose out on around 60 % of the money they could potentially receive .
i would ask you to take this financial perspective seriously , and to embark on effective measures to ensure that it is adopted in december .
– ladies and gentlemen , we are today discussing the outcome of the informal meeting of the european council at hampton court , and not the performance of the six-month british presidency .
i am content with the outcome of hampton court .
let us take a look at the energy situation , for example .
europe is increasingly dependent , already to the tune of 65 % , on one source and that source is in very unstable regions , either former soviet territories or the middle east .
we therefore need a common energy policy , and a common foreign and security policy , although first and foremost we need money to finance these common policies .
that would be the biggest achievement of the british presidency , which will be under discussion on 20 december .
i believe that the outcome will be a positive one .
mr president , mr straw proudly told us that we have had 48 ministerial speeches during the british presidency but i have to say that we have very little to show for any of them .
i am amazed that with just a month to go before it comes to an end , the uk presidency is still talking about agendas , strategies and timetables .
i speak for those many people of east anglia who want to see action , security , prosperity and a real change of direction in the eu , rather than empty promises .
citizens of many countries have woken up to what has been happening in their name .
they seriously question the nature and direction of the eu project .
people want more local control over their own lives , but our governments continue to cede powers to regions and to brussels .
i ask you : what sort of relationship with what sort of europe is right for our people and our nations in this first half of the 21st century ?
that vital question is never asked by our government or by the eu institutions .
it should perhaps have been the central question at hampton court .
the fact is that at hampton court there was no fundamental reappraisal of the european union .
it just carries on regardless .
there are dozens more such irrelevant and interfering items of eu legislation on the stocks .
what is being done about all this ?
the budget was mentioned .
pretty fundamental , but still unresolved .
in comparison with a similar sized economy such as france , the united kingdom already contributes disproportionately to the eu budget and that is after margaret thatcher ’ s rebate .
apparently you want us to pay more .
meanwhile our nations and societies are being dangerously fractured as a consequence of catastrophic asylum and immigration policies .
instead of creating and sustaining world class centres of academic excellence , we are destroying them through lack of funding and misconceived class-driven doctrines .
our armed forces are desperately over-stretched and lack key items of equipment .
at the same time gallant officers and soldiers are hung out to dry by a government-inspired system that cares little for their wellbeing but everything for its own political agenda …
mr president , the hampton court summit was to discuss how europe could do better in the world .
people in ethiopia voted in their masses in may under eu eyes , but the first results did not please the ruling party .
suddenly , the observers were obstructed , media openness was suppressed and demonstrations were banned .
people were brutally repressed in june : over 40 were killed and 5 000 arrested .
despite that , a few weeks later , prime minister meles attended the gleneagles summit hosted by the british presidency .
in september , several governments and the president of the commission sent him messages of congratulation .
yet , a few days later mr meles was officially wined and dined in germany .
did you consider this at hampton court ?
can the president-in-office say that europe is doing enough and doing its best for human rights , democracy and development in ethiopia , the second most populous country in africa ?
it is a particular pleasure for me to be speaking alongside president barroso .
the debate following the departure of foreign secretary jack straw was taken forward by mr pistelli , who spoke of the european union being like a family .
clearly , on the basis of our brief discussion this afternoon , it is a family within which , like any other family , there can be disagreements from time to time .
but i certainly concur with his view that there are challenges that we face in the weeks ahead .
a rather less lofty point was then made by mr hudghton .
but i , unlike him , am aware that i speak today for the presidency of the european union rather than simply rehearsing domestic political disputes between our parties .
mrs bobošíková spoke of the opportunities provided by globalisation .
with that i certainly concur ; that was a central focus of much of the constructive and useful discussion that took place at hampton court .
mrs sudre emphasised the need for agreement on future financing by the end of december .
as the foreign secretary made clear , we are working towards that aim .
indeed , a number of other speakers addressed this continuing issue of the importance of reaching agreement .
i will say a word about that in a moment .
mr zingaretti generously acknowledged the importance of turkish accession .
for that i am grateful .
it reflects the distinctive approach taken by jack straw as the foreign secretary , whereby – somewhat similar to future financing – questions were raised as to the strategy the presidency was adopting .
i am glad to say that on the occasion of 3 october we secured the outcome for which so many of us had worked for so long : seeing the accession talks beginning both with turkey and croatia .
i hope that we achieve a similar outcome in relation to future financing .
mr davies , who has now left the chamber , again emphasised the importance of future financing .
if what mattered was simply the motivation of the presidency , we would have seen agreement reached in june rather a situation in which five member states were unable to accept the luxembourg proposals .
mr karas questioned the importance of enlargement in the face of enduring significant competitive challenges that we face , such as unemployment .
surely the very point that he makes about enduring unemployment and the need for us to address those challenges , makes the case for hampton court .
it is necessary for europe to have a clearer sense as to its future direction before we would be able to try and secure the consensus we want on the basis of the financing of the european union .
i am sorry to disappoint him : as regards future financing , there can be no guarantees that agreement can be reached .
what i can guarantee is that the british presidency is earnest in our endeavours to try and reach that agreement , but critical days and critical discussions lie ahead .
it is important for all the relevant parties to recognise how significant the progress reached since june – where disunity rather than unity was the hallmark of the conclusion of the discussions – will need to be .
mr rouček said that he was content with the outcome of hampton court and argued for an honest , fair and well-balanced deal on future financing .
with that i would have no disagreement .
i disagree with many of the points that were raised by mr van orden , who has now left the chamber .
he ranged very widely indeed while claiming to speak for the people of east anglia , before having his microphone switched off .
today i pay tribute to the personal commitment of president barroso and indeed to commissioner verheugen in driving forward this agenda during the british presidency .
mrs gomes raised important challenging points in relation to human rights , democracy and development within africa .
i can assure members that this remains a continuing priority of the british presidency .
i think that message was very clearly transmitted to the british presidency today .
i understand what the foreign secretary jack straw said before he left about other issues that were very important and that will have strategic consequences .
precisely because of that , it is important to get an agreement on the financial perspectives , because this will be the first test for the enlarged europe .
there are some people who believe that with 25 member states we cannot work and we cannot deliver .
there are some people who believe that a greater europe will be a weaker europe .
i know that is not the idea of the british presidency , i know that is not the idea of the commission .
we believe in this greater europe we are now building .
we believe it is a great achievement that we now have 25 free , democratic member states – as we have .
however , we cannot do enlargement on the cheap .
we need resources for this new europe that we are helping to consolidate .
and this not only applies to the current situation in europe , but also to the future of europe , future accessions to europe , to our capability to build a europe .
however , for a greater europe we need greater politics .
and that is the point .
are we able to do it ?
can we deliver ?
that is why i urge the british presidency to do everything in its power – and i well know the energy and commitment of your prime minister and indeed of all your officials – to get an agreement .
of course everyone has to move : it is not only the responsibility of the british presidency .
of course it is not .
but i really believe the key to the problem , or it would be better to say the key to the solution , is in your hands .
you can achieve that agreement , at least among member states .
we came very close in the last formal european council : we can do it .
in fact , everything that we have done so far has been , from my point of view , a great contribution for europe .
that is the great challenge .
so let us do our best , let us ask all the heads of state and government to be ready to compromise ; let us ask the british presidency to do its very best .
i believe it is possible .
it is difficult but it is possible , and the real test for our leadership is to make possible that which is necessary and i believe we can do it .
the next item is the council and commission statements on the recent statements of the president of iran , mr mahmoud ahmadinejad .
during the last debate on this subject in this house on 12 october i used those same words in indicating that discussion on iran was timely .
it is right , therefore , that the european union should be active in shaping that debate .
iran ’ s decisions about its relations with neighbouring countries can affect the security and prosperity of peoples well beyond the region of the middle east .
it is important for the security of the region and beyond that iran now makes wise choices .
as all members of this house will know , iran elected a new president in june of this year .
i believe that the international community , and particularly the european union , must maintain its dialogue with iran ’ s new government .
we have a responsibility to encourage those who now hold power to make choices that are in the best interests of that country and the region as a whole .
as i said the last time i had the privilege of addressing this parliament , iran is a land of genuinely vast potential .
it has a young , educated and entrepreneurial population .
it has immense natural resources , in particular oil and minerals .
i suggested that the combination of these factors should make for a vibrant economy and society in any country if its government can create a culture of opportunity based on the rule of law .
today , more than ever , there is a real need to encourage the growth of such a culture within iran .
i know that many honourable members of this house were , as i was , outraged by the recent remarks made by the president of iran about israel .
these are deeply troubling statements .
moreover , they have been made against the background of mounting concerns about iran ’ s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes , its human rights record and its commitment to countering terrorism .
let me turn first to those specific comments .
as you know , on 26 october , president ahmadinejad addressed a conference in tehran on the subject of a world without zionism .
in his speech he is reported to have called for israel to be wiped from the map and said ‘ the islamic world will not let its historic enemy live within its heartland ’ .
the european union led the international response which was swift and , i am glad to say , unequivocal .
the presidency statement issued on behalf of the european union heads of government meeting at hampton court on 27 october strongly condemned president ahmadinejad ’ s remarks .
josep borrell said on behalf of this esteemed body that you were ‘ deeply shocked , sickened and revolted by this statement ’ .
he spoke of total condemnation by the leaders of your political groups .
i know that hans-gert poettering , who will be speaking in a moment , also expressed his concern at these comments at that time .
today in this debate we are being called upon to discuss these remarks and their implications .
calls for violence and the destruction of any state are manifestly inconsistent with any claim to be a mature and responsible member of the international community .
the presidency summoned iran ’ s chargé d ’ affaires in london to protest at these remarks , and many governments across our union of 25 nations did likewise in their national capacity .
i welcome the swift response from the wider international community , including from governments within the middle east region itself .
saeb erekat put it eloquently on behalf of the palestinian authority when he said he hoped president ahmadinejad will focus on adding palestine to the map rather than calling for israel to be wiped from the map .
i hope that president ahmadinejad will recognise the damage that these remarks have caused to its standing in the international community and withdraw them unconditionally .
his remarks are a further reminder of the imperative for iran to take steps to address international concerns about its intentions in relation to the nuclear programme .
iran ’ s nuclear ambitions were discussed by european union foreign ministers when we met in brussels on 7 november .
these include a reinstatement of the full suspension of all fuel cycle activities .
the european union ’ s preferred approach remains the resumption of negotiations within the framework agreed in paris last november .
the european union has urged iran to take the steps necessary to make this possible .
a satisfactory resolution of the issue of iran ’ s nuclear ambitions is of fundamental importance to the international community .
a nuclear-armed iran would add greatly to instability in the region and it could do irreparable damage to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the rest of the international non-proliferation system .
turning to the field of human rights , we continue to be deeply concerned by the serious and continuing violations by iran .
we continue to hear reports of juvenile offenders being sentenced to death .
iran continues to restrict freedom of expression and to imprison political prisoners , such as the investigative journalist , akbar ganji .
iran continues to persecute religious minorities , including the baha ’ i community .
i know from our last debate on this issue that this is a matter of ongoing and profound concern to many members of this parliament .
we therefore urge iran to strengthen respect for human rights and the rule of law .
it is important that iran take steps to resume substantive discussions under the dialogue .
i welcome the resolution on human rights that canada tabled last week at the united nations general assembly .
european union member states have agreed to co-sponsor it .
iran must demonstrate by its actions that it is willing to improve respect for human rights .
iran can begin to do this by fulfilling its obligations and earlier commitments in relation to juvenile executions and by permanently releasing prisoners of conscience .
i hope that iran ’ s government does this without delay .
turning now to terrorism , the council remains concerned by iran ’ s approach to terrorism .
the european union has encouraged iran to join , without reservation , the international consensus on the necessary existence of two states – palestine and israel – living peacefully side by side within recognised borders .
the european union stresses that support for palestinian terrorist groups is unacceptable .
all states have a responsibility to work together to combat the threat of international terrorism .
i believe that this is genuinely a crucial time for iran and for its government .
the recent remarks by president ahmadinejad have focused attention upon iran and its position in the world .
it is imperative that this attention be channelled constructively into effective influence on iran to address its policies on the nuclear issue , terrorism , human rights and regional and other questions , including the middle east peace process .
the international community can have most influence when it is united .
i believe our united response to president ahmadinejad ’ s remarks about israel has been successful in putting iranian policy on this issue directly under the spotlight .
it is up to iran to determine through its actions whether its long-term relationship with the european union will improve or deteriorate .
there was indeed a very broad and very speedy reaction from all the different european institutions .
president barroso reacted immediately on behalf of the european commission by issuing a very firm condemnation in the clearest possible terms .
we know that the president of the european parliament has also condemned this statement very forcefully and , as mr alexander has already said , the european council also issued a very strong declaration from hampton court .
i also reiterated in public that mr mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s statement on israel was shocking and completely unacceptable .
it has also rightly been condemned in the strongest terms across the international community .
i would also like to thank the presidency for having associated our heads of delegations in statements made by the presidency , together with the commission , especially in the arab countries .
the foreign ministers further reiterated this collective condemnation of calls for violence and for the destruction of any state .
they also concurred in the fact that ‘ such comments cause concern about iran ’ s role in the region and its future intentions ’ .
there is a long , very ugly string of precedents at political rallies , military parades and other events , going all the way back to the early years of the revolution .
on the most burning issue , the nuclear track , we still believe that engagement is far preferable to brinkmanship , confrontation and isolation .
in this regard the next meeting of the board of the iaea will be crucial .
clearly we all want to avoid iran becoming a nuclear weapons state .
but this is not the only area where we would expect the iranian government to deliver .
iran ’ s attitude towards the middle east peace process in particular is very important .
during mr khatami ’ s presidency , we used this channel of engagement to good effect .
even though iran did not officially acknowledge the existence of israel , we registered some positive signs and a better appreciation of the whole middle east equation .
in particular , it was stated that iran would not obstruct the peace process and would not pretend to be ‘ more palestinian than the palestinians ’ .
but the intemperate remarks by president ahmadinejad came as a setback .
thunderous neo-revolutionary warnings by the iranian leadership to other muslim countries not to recognise israel seem curiously out of step with the modern world and may very well backfire .
over the past months , the eu has invited iran to reactivate our tracks of dialogue , by holding sessions of both the comprehensive dialogue and the human rights dialogue .
i strongly hope that iran will recommit itself to these processes and seize the opportunity to clarify its position , dispel misunderstandings and start restoring an overall confidence that has been badly damaged by recent remarks .
improvements are indeed badly needed and the european union obviously cannot remain silent on the matter .
i believe that we should try to build bridges with the iranian people and i prefer to think that not all iranians identify with the remarks and the line taken by their leaders .
freedom of expression and association in iran are eroding .
we should continue to monitor closely , for instance , the treatment of individual cases , such as that of mr akbar ganji .
that includes iran ’ s attitude towards the middle east peace process .
the ball is now in the iranian government ’ s court .
as a basic prerequisite we expect the iranian government to exercise responsible leadership , both domestically and internationally .
iran has remarkable historical , cultural and geo-political assets , as well as immense natural and human resources .
this entails special responsibilities in order to foster peace and stability within a particularly volatile neighbourhood .
what president ahmadinejad of iran said on 26 october about wiping israel off the map is so monstrous that it must be condemned in the strongest terms .
we know that the ayatollah khomeini , who led the iranian revolution , took a similar line , but we are now all the more grateful to the former president khatami for distancing himself from it .
of that , the iranian government must be made aware .
the tragic thing is that this behaviour on the part of what one must call the new iranian regime does nothing to help those whom it is intended to help , namely the palestinians .
what the president of iran is doing puts the middle east peace process as a whole at risk , and that is bad news not only for israel , but also for the dignity of the palestinian people .
following our criticisms of ahmadinejad , i saw on german television demonstrations in teheran , with men wearing suicide belts , something that in itself constitutes an incitement to terrorism .
yesterday , too , a british colleague told me that two people had been hanged in iran as a punishment for homosexual relations .
all this shows that what we are dealing with here is a reversion to the worst of the middle ages , and we must get the iranian leadership to see the error of their ways .
both the president-in-office of the council and commissioner ferrero-waldner mentioned the civil nuclear programme .
we must be very vigilant where iran is concerned .
iran must itself be aware that it is throwing away its chance of playing a major geographical and strategic role .
iran has a major role to play in the peace process in afghanistan , the peace process in iraq , in relations with syria , israel , lebanon , and palestine .
the iranians are a great people , many of whom took no part in the election because they feared the worst and could not prevent it .
there are people of good will in iran , and we should not forget them .
iran needs a good future , and it is to be hoped that its president will come to realise that he needs to adopt a civilised approach in his dealings with both people and states around the world .
the socialist group in the european parliament believes that the seriousness of what has happened should not be underestimated , since those words were uttered at an extremely sensitive moment in the middle east situation .
the truth is that fortunately , within days , we heard the statements by the former leader mr khatami , which ran in a completely different direction .
in fact , he came out against any kind of crusade , war or violence , declaring them immoral .
on the other hand , however , we realise that this process has many enemies and that terrorism is in fact backing those who do not want a solution to this tragic situation .
peace , democracy , freedom and social justice are the values that we want to prevail in the middle east , and we want europe to play an ever greater role in making that happen .
we therefore welcome the fact that the european union has accepted responsibility for controlling the border at rafah , which we hope may soon become one of the borders of the palestinian state .
iran is a great country and we do not want it to isolate itself from the international community .
quite the opposite : we believe that the decisions it makes , starting with a clear and incontrovertible rejection of nuclear weapons , can help bring about peaceful stability throughout the region .
israel and palestine are linked by a single destiny and wiping out israel would mean wiping out palestine .
i say that because it is time to unmask those who help to maintain the palestinians ’ tragic situation by pretending to uphold their rights .
unlike president ahmadinejad , we shall strive to add a new state to the map of the middle east .
lastly , let us assure israel that europe cannot forget the holocaust , because that would mean denying the very reasons for its existence as a political project .
iran is a cradle of civilisation and has made an invaluable contribution to mankind ’ s cultural , artistic , religious , intellectual and scientific heritage .
when iran became an islamic republic , it was isolated for decades .
the european union has taken the lead in bringing this isolation to an end , and a comprehensive debate has been set in motion about such things as economic relations , international cooperation and human rights .
israel ’ s right of existence within internationally recognised borders and in safety alongside a viable palestinian state is not a matter of dispute .
iran would do well to contribute to a solution in the middle east and to stop supporting international terrorism .
the latest statements by its president threaten to plunge iran , which is indeed a big country , back into isolation and , in any case , prevent it from playing a leading role in its region .
the commission and the council , too , have spelled out the serious problems that we face .
hence my appeal to the people of europe and to this house : we must draw distinctions .
iran is a fascinating country with a young and well-educated society .
there are also , in iranian society , active women ’ s organisations that fight for women ’ s rights .
iran is also represented by such a man as akbar gandji , whose life is at risk because he refuses to submit to censorship .
iran is also a society full of webloggers and journalists attempting to remain in contact with us and to reveal the truth about their country ’ s regime .
iran is also the nobel peace prize winner shirin ebadi , who has addressed this house .
iran is also the lawyer abdolfattah soltani , whom we once invited to this house and who is now in jail .
it is to this other iran , then , that we should try to stretch out a hand .
we should not make the mistake of breaking off contacts with its civil society now , of shutting the door on it .
that is precisely what people like president ahmadinejad want us to do , and that is why we must not do it .
we have committed ourselves to human rights , to peace and to the peaceful resolution of conflicts .
that is our way .
that is only the dialogue ...
mr president , the iranian regime prevents any opposition within the country .
it violates human rights and barbarically sentences people to death by hanging etc . a long list of the regime ’ s crimes can be drawn up , but such crimes are clearly not enough for this regime .
now , the iranian president has made terrible statements about another state .
he has talked about annihilating the state of israel .
his doing so is , of course , completely unacceptable and must be condemned by everyone .
i assume that we are a unified parliament that supports the condemnations both of this statement and of the iranian regime ’ s human rights violations .
there is a danger that the president ’ s statement will make the work to bring about peace in the middle east that much more difficult .
in this context , we must also criticise the state of israel ’ s construction of a wall in the palestinian territories .
this is a wall that , among other things , separates farmers from their land and pupils from their schools and that prevents people who are ill from getting to hospitals .
this wall must also be taken down .
. mr president , iran is developing a nuclear programme that it does not need since it is sitting on a sea of oil .
it is clearly intended to provide the country with nuclear weapons .
the president of iran thinks that israel should be wiped off the map .
we all hope that the situation in iran can be resolved peacefully , and this is certainly one of those cases where the west needs both to speak softly and to carry a big stick .
unfortunately britain ’ s big stick – its armed forces – is being merged into the euphemistically named european defence identity , i.e. a european army .
if accomplished , this will prevent britain from being able to embark on any independent military actions in the future .
but once again , the eu assumes the attributes of a political state in order to address this problem and its pretensions are fully supported by a minister of her majesty ’ s government .
meanwhile , this parliament continually calls on both france and britain to decommission their independent nuclear deterrents .
if they did so there would not be the big stick that might ultimately be needed in any negotiations with iran .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the expressions of hatred and violence uttered by the iranian president , aiming at wiping the state of israel off the map , are a threat to the whole civilised world .
iran is a country of 68 million inhabitants , has an area of 1.7 million square kilometres and is a major oil producer .
if the iranian president does not clearly change his stance , he will be a threat not only to israel and the region , but also to all of us , to peace and to democracy .
such a threat demands the strongest possible response .
the unilateral nuclear rearming of iran must be stopped in line with our resolution of 13 october 2005 and the conclusions of the general affairs council of 7 november .
we must also seek a diplomatic solution to dispel the legitimate concerns about iran ’ s nuclear programme .
as institutions , however , we should continue to foster relations with the people .
the pursuit of a lasting peace means that we must resoundingly condemn and take the necessary action against all those who instigate hatred and violence .
we call on our institutions to pay even greater attention to the opposition movements in iran , which are denouncing the methods that this violent , repressive regime uses even against its own people .
president ahmadinejad ’ s comments caused concern about iran ’ s role more widely within the region and indeed about its future intentions .
frankly it is clear what iran must do .
on the wider nuclear issue , iran must provide objective guarantees that its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes .
the governments of the european union are now in close consultation with each other and key partners such as the united states , russia , china , india and south africa about the next steps .
such a solution would help create the climate we believe to be necessary for a better relationship with europe generally and the international community as a whole .
working and engaging with iran is of course a challenge , but we must do our best to meet that challenge in the important weeks and months ahead .
our preference remains to aim for a mutually beneficial relationship based on cooperation and our shared interests , in that europe wants to see iran realise its potential and to grow and prosper .
but a relationship of this sort will also need to address the european union ’ s main concerns , including , of course , nuclear proliferation and human rights .
in conclusion , on behalf of the presidency , let me say simply this : iran stands at a critical juncture .
the world is watching to see how its new government faces up to the very important choices that it has to make in the weeks , months and years ahead .
we from a european union point of view will continue to encourage iran to address international concerns about its policies and about its statements .
i hope that iran does this and that its relations with the wider world and the european union in particular are therefore able to evolve in the direction in which i believe this house wants them to develop .
the next item is questions to the council ( b6-0339 / 2005 ) .
in response to question 1 , the assessment of the impact of international agreements in terms of companies relocating and restructuring is not within the council ’ s competence .
the council does not have any forecasts for the restructuring of companies .
the european social fund is the main financial tool through which the european union supports member states ’ employment policies within the framework of the european employment strategy .
set up by the treaty of rome , it is the longest established structural fund .
furthermore , the council will be taking forward discussion of the commission ’ s proposals for a globalisation adjustment fund , which could provide assistance for those affected by economic restructuring .
rural development also makes european union funding available in parallel with national funding for developing rural areas .
thus the european structural fund and rural development funding provides the tools to help workers adjust to the situations referred to by the honourable member .
however , the specific details of specific programmes are obviously contingent on the resolution of that matter .
however , it remains the right of member states to set tax rates according to their own national circumstances .
nevertheless , the question concerns the effect that the introduction of any kind of tax on air passenger transport will have within the internal market .
this is therefore an issue that probably warrants consideration by the council , in agreement with the commission .
indeed i hope many of our efforts in the course of the presidency have challenged that impression .
as i suggested in my initial answer , there is provision within the treaties for action to be taken when necessary by the commission .
nonetheless it remains a matter for individual member states to make decisions in relation to taxation , as i sought to declare .
let me give you as an example my own country – malta .
we must look at this seriously , it is not possible that travelling , especially from remote and isolated places , be considered in any way as a form of luxury .
we cannot go to ‘ mainland europe ’ by car , what can we do then , swim ? !
that means that we have to look at it from the perspective of freedom of movement .
there is , as i said , provision for the commission to take action in particular circumstances , and mr muscat is right to recognise that free movement of services is one element of the original treaty of rome .
only this morning i had the opportunity to travel to budapest where i was hearing directly about the seventeen daily flights now available between a number of regional airports in the united kingdom and hungary .
last month i tabled a question for this session of question time to the council on a related subject , that of eu kerosene tax .
i have here documentary evidence that the commission has made proposals to the council .
the issue was last discussed in the council by the luxembourg presidency , prior to the british presidency , which british ministers would presumably have attended .
can the council presidency please tell me whether this is a case of incompetence , or is there a secret agenda to introduce a kerosene tax ?
the convention has to date been signed by five member states of the european union : austria , cyprus , poland , portugal and sweden .
no member states have ratified the convention .
it is noted that part of the convention is under ec competence and will therefore need to be signed and ratified by the ec .
the council is currently considering an action plan on trafficking in human beings to develop a comprehensive and strategic european union approach on this issue .
that is rather inadequate .
that is why they dislike the convention .
the advice that i and colleagues received from the police is that victims will cooperate with police voluntarily once they and their families are safe .
police are dismayed that the chances of a successful prosecution of traffickers are being undermined by a policy of deporting victims as illegal immigrants or making assistance conditional .
mr blair said recently that you need powerful reasons to turn round and say ‘ no ’ to the police .
could he also give reassurances that at least the minimum standards that are written into the eu convention against trafficking are put into that eu action plan ?
they are not in themselves an obstacle to the rights of cross-border shoppers .
the presidency therefore does not believe that further discussion of this issue would be productive .
would he agree with me that we should prefer tax competition between member states to harmonisation of tax rates across the eu ?
if he so agrees , can he see any justification for any limits or guidelines as to how much in the way of excisable products our citizens can take with them across our borders ?
we have sought to take forward , and continue to seek to take forward , work in relation to services .
on the specific issue that the speaker raised in relation to cross-border shopping , let me simply say that the presidency fully supports the rights of cross-border shoppers .
at the same time , though , we are committed to tackling those who abuse freedoms that would otherwise be enjoyed by citizens right across the european union .
we are determined to tackle abuses of the freedoms within the single market by those who engage in illegal activities such as smuggling .
guide levels are therefore essential to assist customs authorities to distinguish between genuine cross-border shoppers and smugglers .
these sanctions , i believe , are proportionate to the nature of the offence .
therefore he is right in recognising that guidelines are exactly that .
i must say that i find the lack of any legal justification in terms of european community law and the european convention on human rights somewhat distressing .
there is little to reassure me about the welfare of my constituents .
its effect is that we are talking about a limited number of couples .
but i would hesitate to go further than that , given that it is not really the appropriate focus for our discussions in this chamber this afternoon .
if one of my constituents who has been caught by the new rule and whose marriage is accepted by the government moves to france , she would have the right to have her husband with her .
so , the bizarre effect is that couples get greater protection of their right to family life in an eu country other than their own .
there is a strong european dimension to this , so i believe it is apt to ask the uk minister to answer as presidency .
the european union has most recently expressed these concerns in the context of the eu-china human rights dialogue , which took place on 24 and 25 october 2005 in beijing .
the european union has also repeatedly raised this issue in other bilateral meetings , including at the highest level .
with a view to china ’ s signature and the process of ratification of the international covenant on civil and political rights , it is of particular importance that freedom of expression be guaranteed in line with international standards .
the joint recommendations that resulted from that seminar were handed over to the chinese side during that last dialogue .
there is a fundamental choice to be made as to whether isolating any one country with which we have disagreements on standards of human rights is the right way forward .
for the first time , the court has been able to conclude that the integrated administration and control system – iacs – has reduced the risk of error for most agricultural expenditure to an acceptable level .
the uk presidency and the commission established a panel of experts which helped prepare a draft council conclusion on this issue .
very briefly , the information note from the european court of auditors says on page 7 that the adaptations and validations necessary to ensure the full implementation of the new accounting framework have been delayed .
why , and for how long ?
on page 8 it concludes that cap expenditure was still materially affected by errors .
it adds that on internal policies the risk of errors will persist unless the legal framework is changed .
will it be changed and when ?
we should all accept that these problems are not the fault of the presidency .
but will the presidency accept that it has a responsibility to press for actions on these recommendations and could it perhaps write to me on the specific points that i have just raised ?
so at every level of the british government and in the course of our presidency , we have recognised the need to take forward work on this issue .
that is why we have been working with the commission to improve financial management and control of the budget .
in january 2005 , the commission introduced a new accounting system , which should offer the court of auditors better information as the basis for giving a positive opinion on the presentation of accounts .
the new system , i understand , will be used to produce the accounts for 2005 .
he is generous in acknowledging the fact that this problem , because it is a real problem for the european union , long predates the british presidency .
would the president-in-office accept that there are few , if any , individuals in brussels stuffing their pockets with money ?
however , we must be take care not to simply deploy that argument in case we are perceived to be complacent in the face of the challenge we face .
all of us with an interest in building and sustaining support for the european union and its efforts amongst european citizens have a strong vested interest in seeing this long-standing problem being resolved .
the challenge , surely , is to recognise that there is a shared problem .
the working group considering the commission ’ s revised comitology proposal has met three times so far and will meet twice more under the british presidency .
i understand , however , that discussions are going well .
may i just thank the presidency for its answer and urge it to persevere .
if we manage to find a solution to this issue which has beleaguered the union for many years , we will be making a notable contribution to our endeavours to regulate better .
so much now comes to three readings each in parliament and council that really ought to be delegated to the executive .
but we will not delegate unless we have the guarantee that we can , if necessary , call things back , in the same way that the council can .
equality between parliament and council is the key to this .
if there is better opportunity for scrutiny , we will in turn be willing to delegate much more readily .
i find myself in concurrence with his view , both as to the importance of this issue and to the fact that we need to persevere .
i can assure him that , from a presidency point of view , we are persevering on this important point and will continue to do so .
finally , i just wish to reiterate that , notwithstanding the fact that these discussions only resumed in september , i am glad to say that real progress has been made in the discussions that have already taken place .
i am optimistic that further substantial progress can be made in the two remaining meetings during the british presidency .
however , there is no choice to be made between security and human rights .
without security there are no human rights , and without human rights there is no security .
following the attacks in london on 7 july this year , the council held an extraordinary meeting on 13 july .
at this meeting the council adopted a declaration on the european union response to those terrible bombings .
in the declaration the council made it clear that , and i quote directly : ‘ the attacks are an affront to universal values on which the european union is based .
the terrorists who reject that commitment and seek to use violence to impose their ideas will be defeated ’ .
they added thereafter that the european union was strengthening , and again i quote directly : ‘ its commitment to combating terrorism and upholding the fundamental principles of freedom , security and justice ’ .
i accept that this is a matter in which there ought to be more choice and it is an issue of striking the right balance .
let us be very clear : the terrorists want to deny us not just life , through their vicious and unprecedented attacks on us , but also our way of life .
that is why i think the statement made by the council on 13 july is such a strong reflection of pan-european sentiments as to how we should deal with these challenges .
working with the presidency , the high representative will present a summary of his initial orientations ahead of the december european council .
this has been something of a recurring theme of the discussions in the chamber this afternoon .
– mr president , do you intend to notify the european parliament , before the december summit , of the compromise text prepared by the presidency ?
given that the united kingdom played a leading role in june in overturning the agreement , is the presidency sincerely willing to move so that an agreement between the twenty-five can be reached ?
have you considered in the council that the british presidency is in danger of proving to be one of the most inefficient and unsuccessful in the history of the european union ?
i can assure the honourable member that i will be back in my customary place in the course of the further plenary sessions of this parliament .
our prime minister has committed himself to coming back to speak to parliament .
whatever other criticisms or scepticism may be directed toward the british presidency , a lack of discussion with the european parliament is perhaps not one of the most forceful .
i would like to ask if it is possible that this compromise proposal will also include a cofinancing procedure for agriculture , in order for agreement to be reached on scrapping the united kingdom ’ s special rebate ?
the council has never debated this question and it is not within its sphere of competence .
the presidency is currently exploring , together with the incoming austrian and finnish presidencies , a series of possible measures aimed at further increasing legislative transparency in the council .
i thank the president-in-office .
let me say what an enormous relief it is to have a few minutes of not debating reach in endless groups around this parliament – a few minutes only , i fear .
i see that mr kirkhope is not here , but i am conscious that he raised this issue in an earlier debate .
i should like to personally thank the president-in-office for his efforts in this matter .
i recognise that he is doing what he can to promote the agenda .
i have here a copy of a letter from mr rasmussen , the prime minister of denmark , stating that he supports a change in the rules of procedure .
i suspect that similar letters could be obtained from estonia and sweden to start off with .
we already know the british position .
that is four votes and you need only another nine .
an options paper will be issued in the coming days and it will be discussed by the antici group before a discussion in coreper ii .
coreper i will also feed into that process so i am grateful for the generous words of the honourable member .
mr president-in-office , you were intrigued by the questioner .
i am intrigued by your answer in pretending that the british government stands in favour of more transparency .
i have in my hand the house of commons european scrutiny committee report published on 24 october .
it contains an answer setting out the british government ’ s position in response to the proposition that there should be meetings of the council held in public .
so , what is the real stance of the british government ?
are you in favour of transparency , or are you in favour of avoiding working in the full glare of publicity , as this answer suggests ?
these options will be taken forward in coreper , as i said previously , on the basis of the options paper at the antici meeting later this month .
that , i believe , is the constructive way forward to ensure that we get the outcome which so many here seek .
i defer to the honourable member in terms of the detail of his historical understanding of this issue , reinforcing the longstanding interest that the benn family has taken in this matter .
i am glad to say that his observations reflect quite the weight of history that lies behind the important discussions that we are taking forward with member states at the moment .
mr president-in-office , i apologise to you and the presidency itself for being late .
i spoke with mr hilary benn on sunday about this very matter when we were at remembrance day in leeds .
i was told by mr blair that it would be fine to go ahead as long as it was within the rules .
i was told by mr straw this afternoon that two options were being considered .
i would like to know whether those options are within the rules or whether we are looking at a change in the rules .
it will not be discussed on 21 november at the general affairs council .
we have instead decided to set out an options paper which will be issued in the coming days of our presidency and will then be discussed at the antici before discussion at coreper ii .
coreper i will also feed into this process .
if it would be of help to the honourable member , i shall certainly ensure that he receives a copy of the options paper when it is issued .
this delimitation of the geographical scope of the agreement is identical to the delimitation in the previous agreement that expired in 1999 and does not in any way prejudice the issue of the status of western sahara .
the initialled agreement is now in the ratification process , which is expected to lead to its formal conclusion in the first quarter of 2006 .
i wish to thank the council for its answer .
the problem with it is that it means that the eu has concluded a fisheries agreement whereby the eu will fish in the waters of western sahara , which is a country occupied illegally by morocco .
none of the eu member states recognises morocco ’ s sovereignty over western sahara .
i think that this is deeply inconsistent and immoral .
i therefore wonder whether there is not a lack of unanimity regarding the council ’ s policy in this area .
the council is offering the un its full support in finding a satisfactory resolution to the question of western sahara , and hopes that a resolution of the situation will be forthcoming .
as i stated earlier , the fisheries agreement does not in any way prejudice the issue of the status of western sahara .
as with the previous longstanding agreement , the new eu-morocco fisheries agreement applies to ‘ the moroccan fisheries zone under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the kingdom of morocco ’ .
the fisheries agreement does not in any way prejudice that issue of the status of western sahara , as the honourable member suggests .
mr president-in-office , i do not think that one can , as mr sjöstedt has just done , simply describe morocco as an occupying power .
the united nations enjoys the council ’ s full support in seeking to find that genuine and satisfactory solution to the question of the western sahara .
we certainly hope that a resolution of this situation will be forthcoming .
questions 16 to 36 will be answered in writing ( 3 ) .
parliament is concerned at the human rights violations in tunisia that have come to light at the united nations world summit on the information society ( wsis ) .
the information society represents a huge opportunity for freedom of expression and the peaceful exchange of ideas , and enables people across borders and cultures to be brought closer together .
parliament ’ s delegation to the wsis led by mrs trautmann will express our position at the meeting itself and at the parallel citizens ’ summit set to take place this week .
we deplore the authorities ’ attempts to stop this peaceful event from taking place .
as parliament made clear in its recent resolution , we stand shoulder to shoulder with all those working peacefully towards the development of democracy and the rule of law in tunisia .
this proposal is dictated by the obligation for the european community to give international commitments to canada , russia and the united states .
consequently , unless the relevant community legislation is adopted , the european community will not be in a position to honour its international commitments when the agreement enters into force .
the scope of the proposed directive is truly restricted .
nonetheless , if it is adopted , it will provide a framework for the adoption of common standards in the european union in order to limit unnecessary suffering and distress for the animals trapped .
the proposed standards are based on the results of serious scientific work within the framework of the international organisation for standardisation and , more importantly , have been adopted by the world conservation union .
the proposal also makes provision for the member states to be able to maintain in force and apply stricter national provisions .
furthermore , the draft directive adds to and does not subtract from existing standards on the basis of current community legislation .
for example , the ban in the european union on the use of leghold traps based on council regulation 3254 / 91 will continue to apply even after the new directive is adopted .
the rejection of the proposal will mean that the european union will be left without any trapping standards in the immediate future and that the european community will be unable to honour its international obligations .
to close , i should like to stress that i shall take account of parliament 's opinion and i shall evaluate the positions formulated both in parliament and in the council .
on this basis , the commission will decide on possible action , including the possible withdrawal of the proposal .
at the same time , the commission is planning to prepare a study with a view to updating the scientific basis for any proposal on the adoption of trapping standards .
the relevant consultations with the interested parties will , of course , also be included .
finally , i should like to express my wish to maintain good cooperation with you in the future .
as commissioner dimas said , the commission proposal of 2004 is the instrument whereby the international agreement is to be implemented .
my proposal that it be rejected was adopted virtually unanimously by the environment committee , with 47 votes in favour , 3 against and 2 abstentions .
i will now proceed to explain why mine was one of the votes against .
as the proposal is covered by the chapter on environmental policy , the european union is obliged to take the latest scientific knowledge as the basis for the legislative proposal .
such a basis is absent ; all that has been done is to incorporate , almost word for word , the agreement negotiated ten years ago .
there are also legal incongruities between the proposal and other eu legislation , including , for example , the directive on the protection of animals used for experimental purposes and the habitats directive .
the commission proposal would allow the trapping and killing of animals protected by the habitats directive .
the proposal is very weak and will do nothing to reduce the suffering of animals caught or killed by means of traps .
the commissioner has himself made clear , and i do myself believe , that we have to recapitulate a certain amount of history if the firm rejection by parliament is to be understood .
it was in 1989 that parliament adopted a resolution calling for a ban on the use of leghold traps in the european union and on the import of furs and fur products from countries in which they were used .
this ban does not apply where one of the two conditions is complied with .
that is also the reason for this international agreement .
suitable legislation or administrative regulations are in force to prohibit leghold traps except where the methods used to catch the animals listed meet internationally agreed humane trapping standards .
this eu regulation would make it a matter of the utmost necessity that trapping standards be established at international level in order to obviate a ban on imports .
the trapping standards prescribed in the agreement reflect norms already in force in russia , canada and the usa and can in no way be categorised as humane .
this house adopted this report by a large majority in 1997 .
so much for the historical review .
we did , though , eventually agree , and so i can say , quite simply , that there are many roads that lead to rome .
this item on its order of business is characteristic of what makes the european parliament peculiar .
we are concerning ourselves with the transposition of an international agreement between canada , the usa , russia and the eu , even though this agreement was – as the rapporteur said – rejected in 1998 .
only in the european parliament can such a thing happen .
what made this achievement possible was years of pressure exerted by the european parliament , by the commission , and also by the animal welfare organisations .
the commission directive that we have before us today contains all the measures of the agreement that facilitate trade , by which i mean primarily the import of animal skins and furs into the european union .
it is for this reason that we believe that its implementation would have an impact on the internal market and should therefore be subject to article 95 as its legal basis .
the fact that this is not the case is another reason for us to vote against this report .
even though my amendments did not attract the support of a majority in this house , i should nonetheless like to bring them to the commission ’ s attention .
it may be that the time is not ripe for certain regulations .
that is why we have rejected the commission proposal .
today – or rather tomorrow , in fact – we face a very tricky decision .
we will be voting in favour of rejecting the commission proposal , but i , for one , will do so reluctantly .
we in this parliament have a duty to contribute to the legislative process and we will be rejecting the proposal tomorrow without giving an indication as to how things should be done instead .
that is , to my mind , a missed opportunity .
it appears that all parties had grievances .
some thought the proposal was going too far , while others felt it did not go anything like far enough .
we ought , though , to decide one way or another .
the commission would also have something to use as a basis if it tables a fresh proposal to implement the international treaty .
i must , of course , also say a word about the muskrats .
needless to say , the dutch dikes must be protected .
we cannot promote animal welfare that is at the expense of our safety .
i am not all that keen on drowning sets , though , and i would urge you as yet to review the trapping of muskrats and the methods used for it .
to my mind , the following conditions must certainly be met before drowning sets can be installed .
first of all , we must have reached plague proportions and , with it , damage to the dikes .
this damage is evident in a number of locations in the netherlands , namely in frisia and south holland , but in brabant , this damage is far less pronounced .
the second condition is that the drowning set is only to be used if prevention has proved ineffective or is impossible to implement , and the third condition is if no animal-friendly alternatives are available .
whilst it is disappointing that europe will not table a workable directive in the short term , it is not the end of the debate .
neither should this , to my mind , spell the painful end of muskrats .
for the time being , it is up to the member states to take their own measures .
i would therefore urge you to thrash out alternatives and reduce the animal suffering to a minimum .
. mr president , my group supports mrs scheele ’ s proposal to reject the commission proposal .
i think that she has demonstrated beyond doubt that this is an example of bad legislation .
for example , the drafting of standards which traps must meet has not been underpinned by sound scientific research .
the criteria to be met by traps and tests for the same are arbitrary .
it is , of course , difficult to measure the suffering of animals .
where does stress end and the battle for life begin ?
moreover , especially in the catch involving live traps , the proposal does not cover the humanity of alternative methods that might have to be used to kill the animals .
animals often drown in a different way , are clubbed to death or kill each other .
there is inconsistency between this proposal and the habitat directive .
what are we to make of this ?
other animals too that fall within the scope of this proposal , including the marten and the badger , are protected or preserved in certain areas .
in connection with this directive , i too cannot help but briefly mention a typically dutch safety issue , namely the protection of its low lands from flooding by dike breaches .
on account of its way of life , the muskrat undermines dikes , which forms a real threat to safety and public health in the netherlands .
a ban on the drowning set – and i can imagine that the proposal will at some point return to such a ban – makes the effective control of muskrats impossible .
dutch safety and public health would be at risk as a result .
i would like to finish off with a comment of a more general nature .
in the european union , we are indulging in animal protection .
a great deal is happening in the area of , for example , cutting down on animal tests .
the cosmetics directive or reach is a case in point .
we also do something about international animal transports .
this is all very important but also highly arbitrary .
we have to ask ourselves what europe would like to do , or indeed has to do , in the area of animal protection .
we can also endorse her arguments .
nevertheless , i would like to stress a few points .
first of all , commissioner , i would like to say that i very much appreciate the preparations you have made in terms of following up this project , in view of the european parliament ’ s position .
i would like to stress how inconsistent the commission ’ s management of this issue of humane trapping has been .
unlike today ’ s events , though , the vote in 1998 was of no consequence , because the council could have concluded the agreements even against parliament ’ s wishes .
this time , however , the commission has proposed a european directive to implement those same agreements , in other words a project that does not achieve the objectives it has set itself .
so why , under such circumstances , would parliament accept such a weak proposal ?
that is our question to the commission .
with regard to the content , too , we find this proposal unacceptable .
in this connection , i think we must look at the arguments put forward by mrs scheele , who explains quite specifically that we are not reducing this suffering at all .
it includes the otter , the wolf , the beaver and the lynx .
and you know , commissioner – and i am well aware of this , coming from france – how difficult it is to enforce the habitat directive , to protect wolves and to try to explain the situation .
mr president , this proposal for a directive from the commission is no great success .
everyone , from hunters to those whose job it is to protect animals , may be said to be dissatisfied with its content .
our political group concurs with the criticism made .
in particular , the content is obviously not based on the latest scientific findings , as a proposal for a directive of this type should , in fact , be .
it is therefore time to withdraw the proposal and start again from the beginning .
as we see it , it is a question of obtaining a balance in the proposal .
animal protection must come first , meaning that considerable improvements to the proposal are required .
when the relevant regulations are laid down , it will , however , be important not unnecessarily to regulate hunting rules in the member states to a degree greater than that required to protect animals against suffering .
in the future too , this must , in the main , be an issue for individual nations .
we hope that the commission will come back with a new proposal .
we would thank the rapporteur for her work and shall vote in favour of the report as it stands .
. mr president , my group supports the proposal to reject this directive , albeit on the basis of arguments that are different from the rapporteur ’ s .
firstly , i take the view that this directive would render the effective control of pests impossible in certain member states – i am thinking especially of the muskrat in the netherlands .
this can have major consequences for public safety .
as long as the proposal contains no exemption in this respect , i cannot lend it my support .
commissioner dimas said that he could understand the concerns of many organisations .
i would like to know if he could also understand the concern we in the netherlands have for the safety of our citizens , if dikes are undermined by muskrats digging burrows .
my second argument for rejection concerns the legal foundation .
protocol 33 to the ec treaty grants the eu competence in the area of animal welfare only in the framework of agricultural , transport , internal market or research policy .
the draft directive implements the international agreement on humane trapping methods , which was concluded in the context of the common trade policy .
i would like to have commissioner dimas ’ reaction to this .
in 1991 , for example , we banned leghold traps and imports of fur from foxes , otters , lynxes and 13 species of animal from canada and the united states .
the ban was intended to apply as of 1995 .
no ! ’ , because , for every muskrat or badger that creates danger , we trap 10 silver foxes that create a profit .
so , mr president , commissioner , let them live !
mr president , i , too , would like to thank the rapporteur for the report .
the vote in committee produced a clear result .
i believe that we all , in principle , are glad to see regulations on the protection of wild animals , and so i regard an all-round approach as desirable .
let us just consider the great differences between the habitats directive , the birds directive and the protection afforded to other animals : those differences are not always justified .
account must , of course , also be taken of animals ’ capacity for causing the sort of damage that endangers lives .
i believe that we need to draw a distinction and simply give priority to human well-being .
let us just remember the breaches in the dams , of which we had such a powerful description from our dutch fellow members .
that having been said , we do , as legislator , have to consider how we can come to the right decisions given the powers with which we have been endowed .
as the basis of these powers has already , however , been the subject of dispute , considerations of legal certainty demand that this issue be examined with great thoroughness .
if we follow the reasoning of the commission and this house ’ s legal affairs committee , the basis is article 175 and that immediately following it .
since , though , this proposal does not take account of the most up-to-date scientific knowledge , i believe that the whole thing needs to be rejected .
this is too important a matter for us not to seek out the best for animals as much as for human beings .
mr president , i am not going to break the mould because i too support the idea of rejecting this proposal .
as everybody else has said , it is hard to see any animal welfare benefits in what the commission is proposing .
i understand that the commission ’ s own scientific and veterinary committee queried the proposal , and there are even some question marks about how it was consulted .
it seems strange to describe how to trap animals that you are not allowed to hunt by law .
i would appreciate the commissioner ’ s comments on that .
they say that you cannot please all of the people all of the time , but i am afraid that this proposal does not seem to please anybody at all .
therefore , i was pleased to hear that the commissioner is prepared to listen to parliament and to find an alternative way forward on this issue .
if the purpose of this directive has been to introduce humane trapping standards for certain animal species , then that purpose has failed .
i would like to draw your attention to article 5 of this agreement , which comprehensively obstructs the efforts of countries which have already introduced hunting regulations surpassing international standards .
if the existing standards only derive from a set of lowest common denominators , parties to this agreement will not be encouraged to consider developing more humane standards .
mr president , i would like to echo the comments that have already been made by several other members in support of the position of mrs scheele , the rapporteur , in her report .
as we have heard , colleagues want to reject the commission proposal for a number of different reasons ; but we are in agreement about the rejection .
this parliament has often shown its political will to protect animals and this weak proposal certainly does not achieve that .
the standards here are not humane .
we are not talking about a few animals , but about millions of animals that are trapped every year in the european union .
there are many areas where the proposal falls short of what can be achieved or what could be achieved to improve animal welfare .
for example , it allows traps that are not classed as humane to be used while better traps are developed , but no time limit is put on this .
the priority is for trapping to continue .
there are no safeguards , as we have heard already , to protect endangered species from being killed in traps in some areas where we know those species are found .
the only way to do that would be to ban traps in those areas .
so for these reasons , and for many other reasons , it is not acceptable and the commission should produce a new proposal .
mr president , the commission ’ s proposal concerning trapping leaves a very great deal to be desired .
under the proposal , traps are to be tested according to strict standards , special training for trappers is to be introduced and home-made traps are only to be permitted in exceptional circumstances .
if this proposal is adopted by the european parliament , it will , in practice , be impossible to engage in trapping in the nordic countries .
it is gratifying that the committee on the environment , public health and food safety rejected the commission ’ s proposal .
hunting issues must be decided at national or local level , not in brussels .
i want to draw members ’ attention to the fact that the committee on legal affairs has issued an opinion concerning the proposal ’ s legal basis .
this opinion has been incorporated into the report by the committee on the environment , public health and food safety and recommends that article 175 form the legal basis for the proposal .
this article concerns the eu ’ s environmental policy .
the protection of wild animals is not , however , a part of the eu ’ s environmental policy and does not even come within the eu ’ s competence .
if article 175 were to constitute the legal basis , there would be a great danger of more and more matters such as this being regarded as eu issues and dealt with at eu level .
i agree with the rapporteur , mrs scheele , that the commission ’ s proposal should be rejected .
mrs scheele is proceeding , however , on the basis that the proposal is not sufficiently far-reaching .
i am of the opposite view .
of course , rules are needed , including in connection with trapping , so that , for example , animal protection is guaranteed .
these rules must , however , be laid down by the member states and not in brussels .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i understand that this proposal will probably be rejected tomorrow .
that is partly because powerful forces here in parliament seem to want to regulate trapping in detail and almost put an end to trapping as such .
it appears almost as though the ultimate objective is that trapping should not take place in europe .
for such people , this proposal is quite simply not sufficiently far-reaching .
even though they are often described as friends of the environment , they often make demands that are anything but environmentally friendly .
the fact is ignored that trapping is an important part of caring for wildlife and the environment .
in my opinion , the commission ’ s proposal is not too limited .
on the contrary , it really goes much too far .
moreover , the commission is trying to extend its powers to issues that the member states really are best placed to deal with .
i have two arguments i hope the commission will take on board with a view to possible future proposals .
firstly , i think that we must take the existing international agreements as our starting point and not try to extend them in a way that is in danger of creating new barriers to trade .
in the last analysis , doing that only hits individual manufacturers and hunters and creates problems .
what is more , i think that , instead of taking a cue from the commission and extending the agreement , it would have been enough to demand that the member states themselves implement parts of this agreement .
secondly , this proposal would give rise to a lot of bureaucracy , which might be done away with .
member states such as sweden have efficient systems whereby all traps are tested .
in order to avoid bureaucracy , it should have been possible to approve the results of tests already carried out on various traps .
i hope that the commission will take these arguments on board and not just listen to the arguments of those who wish to put a stop to trapping .
mr president , the commissioner spoke earlier on about our international obligations .
i would argue that the so-called international agreement is at best ambiguous .
mr maaten mentioned the habitats directive .
however , there is also the protection of laboratory animals in research .
these and others are serious and sound policies for the protection of wildlife and animals that are sadly used in laboratories .
this is an important subject ; it cannot be left merely to the luck of the toss .
air in the atmosphere and the air we breathe is rightly considered a subject necessary for environmental legislation at eu level .
i would say to the previous speaker , mr fjellner , that this proposal falls into the same category of being important and necessary , but at the moment it fails to take account of many previous decisions .
as mr schnellhardt noted , we have to work with other countries in the world – the united states , canada and russia .
however , for our own credibility , i would argue that we can do better than this and we have to do so .
in the light of what the commissioner has heard tonight , i suggest that to avoid humiliation tomorrow , he withdraws it before it is put to the vote in plenary .
mr president , i naturally agree with both my own group and the others that have put forward arguments against the commission ’ s proposal , and i shall not go over these arguments again in this chamber .
in actual fact , i asked to be given the floor just to remind people that animals that live almost unobserved in the wild have better lives than animals kept in cages .
we have seen dreadful pictures from china of bears kept in cages for the sake of their fur , but it is not , of course , only bears with which we are concerned here .
in denmark , we have large fox farms , and these are dreadful too , no matter what type of trapping is practised .
fox farming is outright cruelty to animals .
i think that we must include other animals as subjects of this debate instead of ignoring this problem and only taking an interest in the cruelty to animals caused through trapping .
i should like to emphasise that we must broaden our perspective in order to avoid legitimising the brutal treatment of animals on farms in both china and denmark .
mr president , commissioner , i could not disagree more with the previous speaker .
i think the farming of animals for fur in europe is in much better shape than farming animals in china .
deer farming , fox farming and mink farming are totally different issues .
firstly , the legal basis of the commission proposal is questionable .
secondly , the commission has failed to provide an impact assessment of the proposed directive .
the estimated cost of testing for a single type of trap varies from eur 30 000 to eur 100 000 .
carrying out the testing by technical means would make the requirements more reliable , cheaper and easier to measure and standardise across the member states .
but there is a problem , as mr evans said .
laboratory animals are animals too and we have to take care of their welfare as well .
furthermore , the idea that home-made traps would require a special permit for each use is hallucinatory .
how does the commission think the permit requests of tens of thousands of finnish trappers would be handled in brussels ?
thirdly , like many of the previous speakers i would like to underline the detrimental effects of the proposal on the conservation of wildlife and nature .
the raccoon dog , which is not a native species of finland but is an extremely efficient predator of birds and other wildlife , can only be effectively managed by trapping .
if the trapping were made as difficult as the proposal suggests , the loss of biodiversity would be enormous .
in general , it is essential to rely on local knowledge in applying trapping and hunting legislation .
only local people have sufficient knowledge of the local flora and fauna to help set up balanced legislation .
the wrong kind of intervention at eu level can compromise an otherwise noble objective , as in all areas where subsidiarity should be upheld .
i sincerely ask the commission to withdraw this proposal in order to avoid humiliation tomorrow .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i shall try to encapsulate much in a short space of time .
it was in 1998 that the eu , together with canada , russia and the usa , concluded the agreement on international humane trapping standards .
it follows that it possesses no general competence with regard to the well-being of animals in the wild .
it is because the european parliament , as the european legislature , must respect the member states ’ rights under subsidiarity that it must reject this proposal for legislation irrespective of the good intentions it contains .
i have to tell the commissioner that the enactment of relevant regulations by the member states will discharge the european union ’ s obligations .
it is part of the democratic process which we must take into account .
in all events , this proposal would add to the existing legislation of the member states , not subtract from it : where there is stricter legislation , this would continue to apply .
at the present stage , however , i would like to say that we need to examine all the relevant parameters .
i do not believe that this problem is the fault of the council , but rather the bureau , and i regret that we cannot now hold this debate together with the council .
given that my report evaluates the council ’ s actions , its absence is particularly regrettable .
nevertheless , this is an important , fundamental , issue , as demonstrated by the interest shown by many sectors of civil society in the issue of both arms control and the lack of such control .
we must remember a significant fact : every minute somebody falls victim to a firearm .
furthermore , spending on this kind of export and this kind of purchase prejudices other investments that are often much more necessary for economic and social development .
for all of these reasons , transparency and control in relation to this kind of export is fundamental .
we europeans therefore have a great responsibility .
furthermore , of the main importers , we must stress that china and india are two of the countries that receive and buy the greatest quantities of these types of products .
we have a code of conduct in europe approved in 1998 which is insufficient – as we have been saying for a long time .
it is weak and it is not legally binding .
in fact , the report approved a few weeks ago by the committee on foreign affairs clearly specified the need to strengthen the code of conduct and turn it into a legally binding text .
we are at the end of 2005 , two more presidencies have gone by and we are still waiting .
i would insist that this report represents a step forward and i hope that we do not waste more time in relation to this issue , since we do not have time to waste .
it has to be said that the drafting of the report was politically and technically complicated , taking into account the global character and special features of the threats caused by weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) .
however , the european parliament has been able to tackle the complexity of this issue .
this is worrying because the most influential international organisations and states acknowledge , at the same time , that wmd and their proliferation pose the greatest potential threat to the safety of mankind .
among criminal and terrorist circles , there is a growing interest in wmd and their constituents .
what is more , since the cold war era this threat , far from decreasing , is actually increasing .
the report voices dissatisfaction regarding the inability of the international community to reach a consensus at the non-proliferation treaty review conference held in new york in may this year .
this is seen as a serious blow for multilateralism .
as is well known , the 40-plus priority measures put forward by the european council and commission to improve the situation did not receive adequate support .
this confirms the diversity of interests , tactical thinking and action among states with international influence .
such a lack of trust does not foster multilateral cooperation but devalues the activity of the international atomic energy agency and other special chemical and weapons control organisations .
their information is frequently critical in keeping the issue of weapons of mass destruction subject to international control .
similarly , when the report was being debated within the european parliament ’ s committee on foreign affairs , differing opinions were expressed concerning steps that could be taken internationally on a multilateral basis .
for example , there were differing views about iran ’ s current politically sensitive nuclear programme .
ladies and gentlemen , i will touch on one more aspect of the report which is , in my view , particularly pressing .
it has to be said that currently the absence of a goal-oriented , distinct funding heading is undermining successful implementation of the strategy .
this figure and this level of funding demonstrates the european union ’ s ambitions in previous years , but there is a time when the political will to fulfil commitments that have already been undertaken has to be demonstrated .
the problems that have arisen confirm the need for the european parliament , as an institution with budgetary powers , to participate in ensuring consistent provision for the european union ’ s security strategy .
. mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the issue with which my report is concerned is fundamentally different in character from the things we have just heard addressed .
my discussions and conversations with them have been a source of very useful suggestion , which have been incorporated into the report .
i also want to thank the commission for its very good cooperation , which involved it being willing to delay the adoption of the subsequent white paper until after we had delivered our opinion .
i am also grateful to the interested parties for taking part in our hearings and thereby helping to prepare the sector for these changes .
the topic is a decidedly delicate one , as the procurement of military equipment can be said to touch upon the very heart of national sovereignty .
it was for that reason that the treaty establishing the european community , back in the 1950s , included a derogation clause safeguarding the interests of national security .
the procurement market within the european union remains , however , utterly fragmented , with every country having its own preferred suppliers and purveyors by appointment .
we endorse the commission ’ s proposal that this derogation clause , article 296 , should be clarified and made more precise , and we do so because we have established that it is widely abused .
this clause is used as a pretext for removing practically the whole of the military equipment procurement sector from the internal market .
there is a black hole in the internal market , and that with a total expenditure of eur 160 billion per annum .
we want the public to get the message that the mutual opening-up of procurement markets testifies , among other things , to the member states ’ trust in one another .
i need only mention the current procurement arrangements for the refuelling of aircraft or for guided missiles , where we are largely dependent on supplies from other markets .
let me conclude with a few brief words on the amendments that have been submitted .
