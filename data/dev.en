in particular , the ban on animal protein in feed must be retained .
it is also important to extend these measures to the controls and export bans .
another thorn in my side is that the comitology procedure is being fostered to a certain extent .
parliament as an institution should make a real effort to keep this to a minimum , so that these measures , which are after all very technical , remain subject to democratic control .
it was story of the century in its impact on farming and how we do our business and on the animal feed industry .
i recall interviewing a feed compounder at that time who had no idea where most of his ingredients were coming from , because the word traceability had not been invented .
i think perhaps we forget how serious the situation was .
fishmeal is an important protein source and i think that fear alone should not keep it out of the food chain .
as has already been said , europe produces only about one-fifth of its protein needs and we import soya to fill that gap .
zero tolerance is a big issue for the feed industry and for farmers .
it has caused huge problems and is unworkable .
in my view , amendment 50 is better than amendment 57 when it comes to the adventitious and technically unavoidable contamination of feed ingredients .
we need science to rule here and we need scientific risk assessments of the level of adventitious protein sources in feed .
i think the feed industry itself would welcome clarity on that , because too often zero tolerance has given rise to huge costs as well as concern and confusion within that industry .
we are ten years down the road .
the adoption of this proposal by the european legislature creates a new , solid legal basis for the financing of european standardisation .
european standardisation has already played an outstanding role in supporting european policy for more than 20 years .
for example , it has made a major contribution towards the completion of the internal market .
as part of the new approach , standardisation complements european legislation and contributes to technical harmonisation , enabling unrestricted trade in goods within the eu .
more than 20 directives have been adopted that follow this approach , a concrete example of which is the machinery directive .
standardisation is also an important tool for realising the objectives of the lisbon strategy .
examples are legislation in the fields of environmental protection , control of foodstuffs and the energy and transport sector .
currently , european standardisation receives financial support from the commission on the basis of legal acts from the 1980s .
in view of the development of budgetary rules , it is imperative to update the legal basis for the financing of standardisation .
the budgetary resources for financing european standardisation must be approved annually within the framework of the budgetary procedure .
these currently amount to eur 19 million .
in the course of the discussions , many parties called for european standardisation to take sufficient account of all the relevant interests , such as those of consumers , environmental protection and small and medium-sized enterprises .
the commission shares this view and is working towards improving the present situation .
this decision is not intended to guarantee the financing of the individual interests concerned , however .
i should like to point out in this connection that support is provided for the participation of experts , for example from smes , within the framework of our sme programme .
the same goes for the involvement of consumer and environmental protection and occupational health and safety stakeholders .
it is also the responsibility of member states to guarantee sufficient participation of the relevant stakeholders .
the commission expressly welcomes the amendments drawn up in cooperation between parliament and the council .
we can support all of parliament ’ s amendments .
i should like to express my particular thanks once again to parliament and the rapporteur for their efforts to make agreement possible at first reading .
why do sim cards work in all mobile phones ?
why would it be helpful to have identical power points throughout the european union ?
once things like this function smoothly , they are so self-evident that we hardly notice them .
they draft european standards , which are agreed by consensus and are based on voluntary agreement .
for 20 years now european standardisation has , thanks mainly to the directives known as the ‘ new approach ’ , greatly streamlined european legislation .
directives drawn up in the context of the new approach apply only to basic safety requirements , consumer protection and environmental protection .
technical requirements are set out in detailed technical standards .
this , commissioner verheugen , is the correct way to achieve good european legislation .
when i worked as an architect , standards were a tool i used in my work .
they provided me with a point of reference in designing , assessing and approving buildings .
this was one of the reasons why i accepted the assignment of reporting to the european parliament with a proposal to the european commission on financing european standardisation .
the aim of this decision is to put in place a consolidated legal framework for providing this financing .
even though european standardisation is necessary for the functioning of the internal market , there has as yet been no legislative basis dedicated specifically to financing it .
the eu ’ s contribution towards financing european standards is currently 2 % , while national organisations contribute approximately 5 % , and enterprises 93 % , primarily by providing expertise .
the member states have their roles to play in technical standardisation , in that they have to ensure the adoption of european standards by the national systems .
i am pleased that my country , slovakia , has been among the quickest to transpose european standards thanks to the slovak technical standards act .
i am convinced that european standardisation is a system that will help to create a favourable business environment .
business representatives and other interested parties are becoming increasingly aware of the role technical standardisation plays in the business world .
it must be a priority for parliament to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises , and in particular micro-enterprises and trades enterprises are able to effectively use european standards .
it would be helpful for handbooks to be available to smes explaining the standards to them .
the seven-month discussions between parliament , the european commission , the council and other interested organisations have convinced me that this problem has taken its rightful place in eu policy .
in the approval process i supported all proposed amendments which helped to improve the commission ’ s proposal .
for two years now , the european commission has been seeking to develop standardisation in the context of health , social , societal and environmental services .
standards , when viewed in the specific context of services , tend to be substituted for the harmonisation of european legislation , which is worrying .
however necessary , indeed essential , standardisation may be , it cannot take precedence over legislation .
that is why it is important to ensure , in particular , that all of the parties involved can actually participate in the work of these bodies .
that obviously includes manufacturers , but it also includes consumer associations , clients , local authority representatives or even environmental protection associations .
the compromise amendments certainly address this concern , but only to a very small extent .
on the other hand , i felt that , insofar as public funds were involved , the european parliament had to be informed each year of the standardisation process that had actually been implemented .
european standards organisations are actually associations of general interest in receipt of public aid from the community .
as such , they must obviously meet obligations with regard to transparency .
the compromise amendment regarding this issue makes provision for a commission assessment of standardisation activities to be carried out at least once every five years , which is clearly not often enough .
so there you have my observations summed up in a few words , madam president .
for example , we are currently addressing the issue of mobile tv : the problem of nokia versus lg standardisation .
european standards should be created for this as quickly as possible to enable us to take the lead in the global market .
another example is the allocation of frequencies in the linear-digital field .
if carried out quickly , efficiently and well , standardisation offers prospects of gaining market shares in this field .
a further example is mobile-telephone chargers : here , too , there is a lack of standardisation .
the need for action on this is tremendous , and dramatic progress could be achieved by means of economies of scale .
for this reason , i am also pleased that particular attention is being paid to small and medium-sized enterprises , and i believe that the next thing we need is a green paper on standardisation .
this would enable our economy to achieve the lisbon criteria significantly faster and more efficiently by means of standardisation that is accepted worldwide – one of the best examples of this being the gsm system .
a green paper in this field could give us the opportunity of demonstrating where our future opportunities lie .
this represents a challenge .
parliament is already pleased to note that its cooperation with the commission on this is as constructive as ever .
. madam president , it gives me great pleasure , on behalf of my group and as the coordinator for the committee , to congratulate mrs pleštinská on her first report in parliament .
i am sure that it will be the first of many .
i am really delighted that she has taken on this role .
if you look at the internal market scoreboard , you will see that top of the list of countries that have transposed internal market legislation and adopted european standards are the new member states .
they are putting all the old member states to shame in that respect .
so i believe that she has done outstanding work here .
i am also delighted that we have reached an agreement with the council and the commission in pre-conciliation to get this important package through at first reading .
let me turn to some of the issues .
i have to take issue with the spokesman from the committee on budgets , who has totally misunderstood what this is all about .
as you said , commissioner , it is largely about the development of effective technical standards for products .
that is one of your crucial responsibilities in the new allocation of portfolios in the commission .
but we must not forget that this is all part of the total development of the internal market .
we are now on the verge of a very important review of the future of the internal market .
i share the view of my colleague , mr rübig , that the role of standardisation bodies is crucial in making that market work better .
we still have problems where those standards are not being recognised by member states .
it is still too difficult for manufacturers to take advantage of the single market .
that is where it should be .
if we cannot make the internal market work , what else have we got to do to achieve success in the global economy ?
standards are part of that , not just in europe but also in the world as a whole .
. – madam president , we may soon be able to form a club of those who spend their evenings in this parliament .
it is interesting that the questions raised here are always those that have been followed by the same meps every night .
i , too , would like to start by congratulating mrs pleštinská on her first report .
like mr harbour , i , too , hope that she will draft many more reports in the next three years , during the time that we are meps here together .
this environment enabled us to reach an agreement on every issue following the first reading , and hopefully everyone will be able to support the amendment proposals .
i need to make another brief comment .
mr harbour said that new member states are at the top of the list in transposing internal market regulations .
at this point we need to remember the work of commissioner verheugen in this area , because without him we would never have been able to do this so efficiently .
at that time he was responsible for the enlargement of the internal market .
i personally like the approach of trying to increase the efficiency of the work of existing institutions that already operate efficiently , and making it available to everybody , using a relatively low amount of resources .
personally , i feel that this is the greatest result achieved by this amendment proposal .
it is very important to mention that the appropriate and competent community assistance provided for standardisation is not an expenditure , but a clear investment .
european standardisation complements key european policy objectives by establishing a consensus between economic operators , and has now managed to establish itself in approximately 20 industry sectors .
this has considerably simplified the process of making goods and services on the internal market both comparable and compatible , and so the commission ’ s financial support and continuing development of european standardisation warrants our support .
the catalogue of the three european standardisation bodies , cen , cenelec and etsi , now numbers more than 15 000 standards and other european specifications .
this standardisation work has often rendered detailed community legislation in the areas concerned superfluous , and it is sometimes possible to avoid legislation altogether .
for this reason , standardisation should be seen as an integral part of the continuing efforts towards better lawmaking and thus as part of a policy for growth and employment .
in addition to the internal market aspect , european standardisation has the potential to support a whole range of community policy measures capable of increasing the competitiveness of european enterprises .
this applies in particular to the fields of trade policy , transport , the environment and security of travel documents .
in the field of research and technological development , clear common standards are needed as a source of technical expertise and as a market instrument .
as with gsm and galileo , which have already been mentioned by some fellow members , it is thus possible to create a common trading language .
despite this positive assessment , european standardisation and its institutional framework need to be improved and strengthened .
the provisions of the new financial regulation require the creation of a clear , complete , detailed legal basis for european standardisation .
i believe that the compromise proposal is capable of meeting these requirements .
all the actors involved deserve thanks for their constructive cooperation , particularly the rapporteur , mrs pleštinská .
i shall be recommending that my group support the compromise reached , and am confident that agreement will be reached here as early as at first reading .
incidentally , i believe that we should be holding this debate , too , in brussels and not in strasbourg .
following the introduction of the european standard for playgrounds in 1997 , for example , the rate of children ’ s injuries fell by more than 25 % in austria .
the aim of this directive is not to set up a new office , but to introduce a legal framework for systematically financing standardisation offices and agencies .
there are many reasons for proper financing , but i would like to mention just one .
the offices for standardisation have very limited national budgets in the new member states compared to germany , france or the united kingdom , and they must also carry the burden of translation costs .
this is because standards are incorporated everywhere into national law , but for the new member states they are available only in english , german or french .
small firms , of course , do not have the resources for time-consuming translations .
so if we want to ensure that all businesses make use of these worthwhile standards , they must be made available in all of the official languages .
you will surely agree that it is in the interests of the european community to contribute financially towards the cost of these translations .
i value the commission ’ s proposal highly .
the rapporteur has , moreover , made some valuable additions to it which will , for example , assist small and medium-sized enterprises .
she also proposes measures that will increase control and transparency in respect of the new financing .
i would therefore like to thank mrs pleštinská .
– madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is already rather late , and my fellow members have already made many good points .
first of all , therefore , i should like to join in thanking the rapporteur , and wish to offer her my sincere congratulations on the difficult work she has done .
as deputy coordinator , i believe that this represents an important step .
tomorrow ’ s vote is the result of an informal trialogue aimed at bringing the issue of the financing of european standardisation to a successful conclusion at first reading .
i believe that the compromise that the rapporteur has achieved is a respectable one .
in spite of all the positive aspects pointed out here by various members , however , i would venture to make a criticism , an objection .
yet experience has also shown that many citizens – and many mayors or other economic actors – are not seeing these rules the way they were intended .
there are some rules , such as the pre-standard on the prevention of crime by urban planning and building design , to which mayors are objecting – not entirely unjustifiably , in my opinion .
that was why i welcomed the rapporteur ’ s original proposal for the costs of standardisation to be oriented to a much greater extent towards the costs actually incurred .
owing to past experience , however , this proposal could not be pushed through in the agreement with the council and the commission .
– i would like to start by thanking my colleague , the slovak member mrs pleštinska , for her work in creating this thorough report .
european standardisation has an important role to play in removing technical barriers to trade , and thereby promoting the development of the european single market .
technical standards replace detailed legislative provisions and simplify the rules , which will at the end of the day make the entire european economy more competitive .
defining mandatory basic requirements will also ensure a high degree of protection for consumers , health and the environment .
standardisation is indispensable in sectors such as health care , transport , telecommunications or electrical engineering .
in the health care sector , for instance , there are some 10 000 different medical devices , and in this field european standards play an important regulatory role .
whilst setting out detailed definitions of the requirements for ensuring a high level of patient safety , they also encourage innovation .
since 1985 , when the ‘ new approach ’ to european standards was adopted , more than 15 000 standards have been issued .
the european union , however , makes only a minor contribution to the overall financing of european standardisation , even though studies have shown that the benefits to the economy far outweigh the costs .
for this reason it is important for the eu to provide a sizeable portion of the finance for the entire system not just within the european union , but also on an international level .
we only realise how important standards are when something does not work properly .
i remember how the new member states recently had to rebuild their technical systems .
we must underline the great contribution to this made by the internationally recognised and long-established slovak standards institute .
we now face the considerable task of improving the financing for european standardisation in support of the competitiveness of european industry in particular , and of european policy on global competition .
for this reason this decision is of the utmost importance .
to construct , coordinate and further refine a complex and extensive mechanism of technical standards which functions dynamically requires clear , rational and adequate financial support .
in conclusion i would like to draw attention to the praiseworthy and constructive efforts of mrs pleštinska , who has succeeded in building a consensus over this important issue .
– madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to express my particular thanks for the very constructive spirit that has characterised this debate , and for the consensus that has emerged from it .
this is very important , as technical standardisation is something that , astonishingly , is frequently entirely misjudged in the mind of the european public .
we have all seen how certain standards have been seized on in the public political debate as bizarre examples of ‘ excessive european regulation ’ .
it is a very modern instrument and , from a legal point of view , a very flexible one and the instrument of choice .
. – madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this parliament attaches a great deal of importance to the issue of the democratic control of the european central bank .
this appointment is therefore important with regard to the content of monetary policy .
in that consultation procedure , the profile expected of the candidate is one of possessing the necessary authority and professional experience in the finance or banking sector .
those are the terms of the treaty .
the candidate proposed to us clearly meets those criteria .
we looked into the selection procedure of members of the executive board and we therefore question the council on two aspects of that procedure .
the first concerns the system of rotation of membership on the basis of nationality .
we believe that the european parliament should have the right to a vote of approval , as the members of the commission do .
that is the spirit in which we composed this letter to the president of ecofin .
. – madam president , commissioner , mr stark , the vice-president of the deutsche bundesbank , is a convincing candidate for the executive board of the european central bank .
he was involved in the creation of the framework conditions for the euro as state secretary of the german ministry of finance and is , so to speak , one of the founding fathers of the euro .
he stands for continuity in the european central bank , and for the objective of independence , which is particularly important at a time when increasing attempts are being made to subject the european central bank to external requirements .
with the enlargement of the euro area around the corner , continuity is the overriding consideration .
the issue of parliament ’ s role has also been debated .
i , too , should like to see a strengthening of parliament , and wish to emphasise that mr stark stated explicitly that the role of parliament is very important to him .
that was just an aside .
what we need are candidates with a good image , with the relevant experience , like mr stark .
it must not be a case of who shares our personal political views and who does not .
that is not parliament ’ s job , and i would not follow this course .
i support the objective of ensuring that there are no national fiefdoms in the european central bank .
we must also ensure , however , that both large and small economies are equally represented on the executive board of the ecb .
. madam president , in leading business circles there is a growing recognition that it is imperative to provide for diversity in management and supervisory boards .
diversity in educational backgrounds , work experience , age , gender and nationalities guarantees more sensitive , alert and creative cooperation than just adding more of the same sort of people .
replacing one bundesbanker with another does not promise much diversity and creativity .
but the ecb is not a company and its policy is kept static ; it is apparently deemed that it should eternally remain as it was at its creation .
but in this debate tonight we are not dealing with the policies of the ecb and the eurozone as such , but with the appointment of a new bundesbanker to the executive board .
in my political group , the pse , we are more interested in discussing the procedure leading to this appointment .
originally we proposed to do that in the report that we are dealing with now and we were disappointed that a majority of the committee did not support it .
that was why we abstained in the vote .
it is very important for the european parliament to counterbalance what i see as a strong renationalisation and non-integrationist trend in the way member states deal with these issues .
it is clear where our criticisms are focused : there is apparent evidence that large member states have ‘ reserved seats ’ .
there is a lack of debate about profile and portfolios and this diversity of backgrounds , and a lack of choice .
the issue of appointment is taken as an ‘ a ’ item in the council debate and the european parliament has a very limited role .
we hope that if we have the opportunity to present more proposals , the commission , the council and the ecb will ready to discuss with us a change in this appointment procedure .
but we hope to cooperate very well with any candidate put forward by mr radwan .
the report presented by mrs berès clearly expresses this positive assessment , and therefore has the support of our group .
mr stark gave convincing written answers to the questionnaire presented by the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
at his hearing in committee on 18 april , he then proved himself once more to be an excellent candidate for membership of the executive board of the european central bank .
he is convincing on account not only of his personal integrity , but also of his wide-ranging experience and his competence , particularly in matters of monetary policy .
he played a substantial role in shaping the process of monetary union from 1988 until the introduction of euro notes and coins in 2002 .
thus , he ranks among the architects of the stability and growth pact , and he has spoken out consistently and clearly against watering it down .
he has declared his unequivocal belief in the cornerstones of monetary union , and as a result we can be sure that he will endeavour , as a european , to act for the benefit of all .
in addition , mr stark has given assurances that he is prepared to engage in an open dialogue with parliament .
we members of the committee on economic and monetary affairs shall take him at his word .
i should like to conclude with a few critical remarks , which are of an exclusively procedural nature and have nothing to do with the quality of professor stark ’ s candidacy or with him personally .
in addition , the large euro countries appear to look on the executive board of the european central bank as a fiefdom and exclude the representatives of other member states from the outset .
the chairman of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , mrs berès , has written a letter to the austrian council presidency proposing procedural improvements , as she has just stated .
the alde group expressly supports this proposal .
today we are assessing the candidate himself , and , in mr stark , the council has put forward a strong candidate to succeed mr issing .
i should like to take this opportunity to thank the outgoing executive board member mr issing once again for his work and constructive cooperation .
we need not only greater confidence in the eu , but also great confidence in the independence of the ecb and in the euro as a strong currency .
for that reason , i ask all my fellow members to demonstrate our great confidence in mr stark tomorrow .
. – madam president , the state of public finances has a real influence on the rate of economic growth , employment and macroeconomic stability .
it is also an important indicator of the health of the common european currency .
this is why the treaty on european union clearly states that developments in the public finances of the member states are of interest to the bodies of the union , including the european parliament .
exercising its powers under the treaty , the european parliament has once again reviewed the state of public finances in the european union and will adopt a report on the matter .
the main message behind this year ’ s report is the conclusion that public finances in the majority of the member states are still not balanced and that this situation has not improved significantly since last year .
this calls for continued efforts to improve tax policy .
in effect , public debt has systematically grown in the last few years in relation to gdp and by the end of 2005 rose above 70 % in the eurozone .
since 2003 , 11 european union member states have been running deficits in excess of 3 % of gdp , and 10 countries have been subject to excessive deficit procedures .
this situation clearly shows that some member states are experiencing considerable difficulties in restoring the balance of public finances .
there is a lack of political will and determination to implement the necessary changes .
this state of affairs also shows that the preventive and corrective procedures of the stability and growth pact have not been very effective to date .
one of the main reasons for this unfortunate budgetary situation has been the persistently low rate of economic growth in europe .
the policy hitherto implemented has not succeeded in changing this state of affairs .
an expansive tax policy and a restrictive monetary policy have produced an unfortunate ‘ policy mix ’ and slowed economic growth .
the situation is made worse by insufficient coordination of tax policy in the eurozone .
in this context , the slow progress made in implementing the lisbon strategy gives particular cause for concern .
madam president , in the report we suggest a list of measures aimed at improving the state of public finances .
first of all , it is necessary to adhere strictly and rigorously to the tax regulations set out in the modified version of the stability and growth pact .
this will help the pact to regain credibility and strengthen its disciplinary role .
we call for faster structural reform , and in particular for the decisive implementation of the lisbon strategy .
we also propose measures aimed at streamlining fiscal procedures , increasing coordination and improving the effectiveness of tax policy .
we call on the european commission to assess the likely effect of increased tax policy coordination on economic growth in the union .
we suggest that a single set of macroeconomic assumptions whose source could be the european commission should be accepted as the basis for drafting the budget in the member states .
the measures mentioned are necessary in order for tax and budget policy to contribute to faster economic growth and increased employment in the european union .
the european parliament should send out a clear and unambiguous political signal on this matter .
that is why i turn to you , my colleagues , and ask you to endorse this report .
i should like to discuss that briefly .
the second comment that i should like to make relates to the particular subject of public deficits .
the report notes that the situation worsened in 2005 and attributes that to the incorrect application of the stability and growth pact .
according to our forecasts for 2006 and 2007 , this situation will continue and , if the member states adopt additional measures , we will see a clear improvement .
apart from these two comments , there is considerable convergence in everything else between the proposals and statements in the rosati report and the commission ’ s opinions and criteria .
we have a unique opportunity in our hands to use europe ’ s institutions and the european dimension to meet the people ’ s demands and aspirations .
the committee on economic and monetary affairs supported this draft by an overwhelming majority – i would almost say unanimously .
naturally , it has also been endorsed by the group of the european people ’ s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats .
we shall naturally assess the amendments tabled critically , and so i am very grateful that the commissioner , too , has criticised two or three aspects of these amendments .
unfortunately , this idea is not popular with all european governments , who often lack the political will to make budgetary reforms .
they have to clearly observe the criteria laid down in the stability and growth pact rather than repeatedly attempting to circumvent them .
in 1997 – several of us were present at that time – these were termed ‘ stability criteria ’ , as they lend stability to the financial area and economy in europe .
european governments should not now view these criteria as a scourge or obstacle to their development , therefore , but as a sustainable path to a healthy economy .
large budget deficits have an adverse effect on economic developments .
indeed , as we have just heard , there have been some changes in this regard .
increases in these deficits only perpetuate this spiral , and it is imperative that they be stopped .
a long-term policy of balanced public finances is needed in the current euro countries and must also be made an indispensable requirement for all future accessions to the euro area .
the stability and growth pact and the monetary policy of the european central bank provide a reliable , satisfactory framework , and all we need to do is to stick to it .
. – madam president , i should first like to respond to what mr almunia said about something that is included in paragraph 8 of the report with regard to the incorrect application of the stability and growth pact .
i agree with him that we did not claim either that this would be a case of incorrect application .
that is why we have tabled an amendment to correct this wording .
i would also ask the other groups to look into this .
our amendment 7 tries , in fact , to remove this wording altogether from the text .
with regard to the statistics and prognoses , your remark that the content of the 2005 report has seemingly been superseded underlines once again how relative these prognoses and statistics are .
only one figure matters , in fact , namely that of inflation , while many member states would envy that country for its achievements in other areas of public finance .
i only say this to illustrate the relative nature of the figures .
we consider the recommendations that are issued to the euro group in a bid to improve the procedures another important element in this report .
i think that in this respect , there is much room for improvement in order to make this more predictable and more comparable in a european context .
i think it is crucial that this be flagged in this report .
the same also applies to the quality of the statistics .
that is another important point we have raised several times , and we would like to support the commissioner in his attempts to make improvements in that area too .
finally , i would like to draw your attention to , and at the same time underline , the last paragraphs of the report .
. – i thank the member of the commission for the good news about the european union 's improving economic situation – this is one of a few pieces of good news for lithuania today .
however , i would like to talk about the public finance policy .
therefore we must determine reference points in the public finance policy which would help to reconcile the member states ' interests with the objectives of the community .
it must be emphasised that the report presented by mr rosati reflects to a degree the endeavour of balancing both these viewpoints , and i would like to thank the rapporteur for this .
it is the alde group 's opinion that the following measures could ensure more effective coordination of the european union ’ s public finance policy .
firstly , measures of organisational nature , that is , forecasts of basic economic indicators made at the community level , which would increase the reliability of the member states ' financial forecasts .
secondly , preparation of coordinated timetable of budgetary procedures of the eu member states , preferably for at least two years .
measures of an economic nature , which we would support , first of all include the need to define a european macroeconomic policy which is outward-looking and competitive .
in this respect there could be more coordination in ecofin council meetings .
appropriate tax initiatives , which stimulate modernisation of the economic structure and citizen activity , should also be a priority .
the third priority should be the fostering of fiscal discipline , based on the best practices of the member states .
the fourth measure is extremely important – we believe that attention should be turned from encouraging private investments to encouraging savings , as this is one of the basic macroeconomic initiatives .
the time has come to rethink the level of priority that continues to be attached to the monetarist , neoliberal policies of the lisbon strategy and to the guidelines of the european central bank .
what is therefore needed is a monetary and fiscal policy that will boost economic recovery and help combat unemployment .
furthermore , the stability and growth pact should be repealed and replaced with a proper social development and progress pact .
we feel that these are some of the vital proposals that will also help us gain the trust of eu citizens .
without that trust , we will certainly continue to live in this atmosphere of pessimism arising from policies that do not address the problems currently facing people in the eu .
madam president , public finances have a huge impact on economic growth , the creation of new jobs and on macroeconomic stability .
the maastricht treaty clearly stated that the course followed by public finances in european union member states should be carefully monitored at european union level .
the main and most pertinent point of this year ’ s report is the unbalanced budgetary positions in the majority of member states .
four of the largest eu economies , france , germany , italy and great britain , are among the countries subject to excessive budget deficit procedures .
the basic causes of the problems are still an excessively slow rate of economic growth in europe , as well as failure to implement the structural reforms required to strengthen public finances for the future .
the reasons for this situation also lie in the low level of internal demand and uncertainty concerning job security , social protection , salaries and pensions .
high energy prices , unstable fuel markets and constant current account surpluses in the majority of asian countries have all shaken the faith of many businesses in europe .
a loose fiscal policy has proved to be ineffective and has not encouraged growth in our economies .
the indicators show rising levels of debt which pose a real problem , especially in terms of long-term budget stability , across the whole of the union .
the initiation of attempts to implement the lisbon strategy in 2000 was supposed to ensure a comprehensive programme of reform .
bearing all these problems in mind , i think that we should take decisive steps to increase the effectiveness of preventive measures , as well as implementing corrective measures to strengthen and consolidate public finances .
i would underline this statement , especially as the lisbon strategy is calling for more money and greater investment , including from public finances – i need only mention education and research .
if we do not put our social security and pension systems in order , we shall be the losers of globalisation at all events .
i am pleased that there has been a trend reversal in the public consciousness with regard to public deficits in recent years .
prior to the introduction of the euro , public budgets tended to be the preserve of experts .
we have achieved a reduction in public deficits , and we must continue on this path , as we need to increase our scope for the future .
for that reason , i also congratulate the commission on the decision it took today , as it makes it clear that we take our rules seriously .
this decision is not aimed at anyone in particular , but rather at ensuring that we take the maastricht criteria and the stability and growth pact seriously .
that is why i am pleased that the public debate has intensified and that we have thus contributed to making the structure of our budgets more future oriented .
madam president , commissioner , i shall begin by thanking the rapporteur for his contribution to our debates .
i should like to point out three factual elements .
the first is the cyclical conditions that place a strain on the public finances of the european union .
given the rise in oil prices , this is an exogenous factor that we must take into account in our public finance strategies .
that is why i should like to point out two lines of action that i consider to be absolutely crucial .
the first line of action is an investment strategy to help genuinely implement the lisbon strategy .
i believe that there is an inconsistency there for which i hope our fellow citizens will not have to pay a heavy price tomorrow .
the second line of action concerns the issue addressed by mr rosati at the end of his report with regard to the conditions for growth and coordination of economic policies within the eurozone .
a large number of commitments have just been made under the responsibility of the president of eurogroup , with the commissioner 's agreement .
i believe that we are on the right track , particularly with regard to the harmonisation of the timetable and of the macroeconomic data on the basis of which the member states evaluate and draft their budgets .
madam president , i take the floor in the debate on the report by mr rosati concerning public finances in order to draw your attention to the following issues .
firstly , the sanitising of public finances cannot be an aim in itself , but must be a means of generating higher economic growth and creating new jobs .
this fall has been even more marked in the eurozone : from 2.1 % to 1.3 % .
unemployment has remained high at around 9 % .
these indicators confirm that the european union is not only failing to catch up with the united states and other developed countries , but is actually falling behind .
here we should add that gdp growth in the united states stood at 3.5 % in 2005 and was therefore more than twice as high as in the european union .
thirdly , a low level of economic growth and continuing high unemployment make significant reductions in budget deficit and public debt difficult .
in the european union of 25 , the budget deficit has fallen from 3 % of gdp in 2003 to 2.6 % of gdp in 2004 and from 3 % to 2.7 % in the eurozone .
finally , the new member states are implementing very difficult reforms based on fundamental changes to pensions systems .
it thus , in fact , wants to punish these countries for implementing far-reaching reforms of their public finance systems .
i would like to voice my strong objection to this manner of dealing with the difficult reforms being implemented in the new member states , especially poland .
– madam president , commissioner , first of all , i should like to congratulate mr rosati , because i think he has produced an excellent report , which takes on board contributions from the other political groups .
in my speech tonight , i should like to focus on the relationship between public deficit and economic growth .
the commissioner has provided us with more up-to-date information .
despite that , i would dare to regard the european union public deficit situation as worrying : 2.4 % on average is better than 2.9 % , but it is still worrying .
the fact is that the european union – europe – is the region of the world , including the less developed parts of the world , that is achieving least growth at a time of international economic expansion .
thus europe is not keeping its own house in order and it is not doing what it ought to be doing in terms of balancing the international economy .
it has the ability to do so , but its problem is that its growth potential is so terribly low , incomparably low .
we are the area of the world with least growth potential , and that is where the problem lies .
– madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report .
the report begins by stressing that the eu ’ s main problem is weak economic growth , the persistently high level of unemployment and the inadequate use of the production capacity in place .
this , in my view , is a crucial message .
indeed , balancing public finances must not be seen as an end in itself .
the early shoots of growth have emerged in spite of , rather than because of , the pact .
public and private investment must be increased in the fields of innovation , education and the development of new skills and technologies , in accordance with the lisbon strategy .
intergovernmental cooperation and the coordination of economic policies at eu level are key factors and are currently not being sufficiently exploited .
maintaining sound public finances is only of interest if it is sustainable in the medium term , which often means taking measures of a structural nature .
it is time for economic operations based on extraordinary measures or creative accounting to disappear for good , because they undermine credibility and erode the trust of investors and consumers .
to sum up , public finances must be consolidated , but it is only worthwhile doing so sustainably and provided that this goes hand in hand with the strengthening of the european economy and the skills of its citizens .
i feel that these are the two key messages to take from the report before us today .
– madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i am very grateful to be given the floor once more this evening , at an hour when , in fact , the debate is drawing to a close .
the rapporteur is right to address his appeal to the member states .
i take the liberty of drawing attention to a further point .
in 2007 , germany ’ s budget deficit will be below 3 % , and consequently we shall meet the criteria of the stability and growth pact .
indeed , commissioner almunia said so himself in appropriate terms .
the development of germany ’ s economy will thus give the eu as a whole new momentum – or at least that is my hope .
i believe that we have not yet gone far enough down this route and that some work remains to be done in this regard .
despite the rise in oil prices , inflation remains stable , and even consumption in the eu is at a level that could certainly be called acceptable .
for this reason , we do not need pessimism , but rather action , particularly with regard to the improvement of the economic climate and the further integration of the internal market .
in this respect , i hope that the report by mr rosati also points the commission in the right direction .
– madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the member states ’ economic policies are a matter of joint interest .
supervision of their public finances is essential to ensure that their commitments , which are greater in the euro zone , are fulfilled and that our shared aims are achieved .
i congratulate mr rosati , because his report identifies the main problems with public finances and provides valuable guidelines for treating them and improving their future course .
the situation is worrying but , as the commissioner has said , the turning point may have been reached in 2005 .
until then , the public debt ratio had done nothing but rise ever since the euro had been brought into circulation .
there are still five members of the euro zone subject to the excessive deficit procedure and , indeed , growth in the european economy is lower than in the most advanced countries .
part of the success may be due to the reform of the stability and growth pact , because it has introduced some rationality .
it is important that budgetary procedures have a uniform calendar , respond to common economic parameters and are based on uniform assumptions that improve statistical governance .
it is also necessary to use a cyclically adjusted budget concept , as the rapporteur proposes .
along these lines , i consider it important for national reports to be drawn up on the sustainability of public finances , based on common elements .
madam president , i should like to thank all the members who have spoken in this debate , referring to initiatives or positions held by the commission .
indeed , in recent months there has been a significant improvement in confidence and optimism among economic operators and also among european consumers .
all the indicators point to that .
we are now in the process of trying to convert this confidence and optimism into real evidence of an upturn in the economic situation , with more consumption , more jobs and more economic growth .
i believe we are partly succeeding , although that does not mean it is an easy task .
there is of course a problem – and i agree with those who have pointed it out as one – with the low potential growth of the european economy .
the european economy by itself , without further reforms , is incapable of growing any more than the figures that we are estimating for 2006 , namely slightly more than 2 % .
i believe we are facing a very good opportunity at this turning-point , which mr sánchez presedo mentioned a few minutes ago .
one of the problems with emu is that there is no control by the financial market of the way in which member states conduct their economic policies .
however large the deficits run by member states as part of their overall debt , their ratings are not affected appreciably .
my view may be summarised in three points .
countries newly set to enter the euro area must hold referenda before they introduce the euro .
it is important that people be made fully aware of the real implications of changing their currency .
they must appreciate the consequences of having a fixed exchange rate and of not being able to conduct their own monetary policy .
the example of sweden shows how important it is to have referenda .
secondly , new countries that have public debts in relation to gnp more than 60 % in excess of gnp should not be approved .
this rule has not so far been applied stringently enough .
thirdly , a proportion of new countries ’ state borrowing should compulsorily be from the long dollar market , involving for example ten-year bonds .
this should of necessity give rise to a rating without a corresponding implicit guarantee from the eu countries .
i believe that such dollar bonds would provide a more accurate picture of the countries ’ economies .
ladies and gentlemen , today , 17 may , is international day against homophobia .
i would remind you that , last january , our parliament approved a resolution on homophobia in europe .
in accordance with that text , the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs has organised a seminar this afternoon entitled ' ending the hate ' .
i would like to congratulate the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs on this initiative .
– mr president , i have been in politics for 32 years and regard the freedom of speech and of the press as democracy ’ s greatest assets .
i really do feel under threat .
i would also like it to be known that yesterday – as witnesses will confirm – mr hans-peter martin was behind this team , although he was not there today .
i would ask you , mr president , to cause appropriate action to be taken , since i find this sort of mobbing intolerable .
thank you for telling us about these events , mrs schierhuber .
the secretariat will immediately contact the security services and i would ask you to contact them yourself as well so that the appropriate measures can be taken to prevent these things from happening again .
since this house is our workplace , we should ensure that its members are accorded the same protection that we demand for europe ’ s workers .
this is not the appropriate time to open up a debate on this , unless you are asking for an amendment of the agenda .
we shall deal with this issue in a practical fashion by means of parliament ’ s security services .
mrs schierhuber , i see that you are requesting the floor , but you will appreciate that we cannot turn plenary into a place for discussing all of the incidents that take place in parliament .
– mr president , mr martin was not travelling by car , but i can give the security services the name of the young lady .
he was on foot outside the hotel .
i would ask the secretary-general to call a meeting with the security services and that will give you the opportunity to speak as you see fit .
the spanish people ’ s party has once again used this parliament as a trench from which to shoot its lies at the spanish government , accusing one of its ministers of an assault against spanish democracy .
he also said that he would take those lies and that complaint to the commission and the council .
mr moreno , what you have said does not relate to a point of order and has nothing to do with the minutes .
speeches on the minutes are intended to point out that the minutes do not reflect what has been said , not to express an opinion about whether or not what has been said is relevant .
what you have said is not appropriate unless there is an error in the minutes or unless they do not reflect exactly what has been said .
they are committing themselves to improving the agreement that has been in force up to now and amend the council decision of december 2005 .
what that means is that our budget procedures can be more flexible .
it means that we can respond better and more quickly to exceptional political , humanitarian and economic circumstances .
the commission , the council and parliament are also committing themselves to modernising the financial instruments by drawing on the european investment bank ’ s lending facilities .
that will be important in terms of research , innovation and small and medium-sized businesses and could create an important leverage effect by boosting investments .
the agreement with the council in december was also underpinned by what i have no option but to call targeted rebates and christmas presents .
in foreign and security policy and in the neighbourhood policy , too , we have been able to make substantial improvements .
we have not , by a long way , achieved everything , but we have been able to negotiate a big package and , to some extent , to make cracks in the council ’ s concrete structures .
implementing the reforms , in particular , will bring considerable pecuniary benefit to the union , to the member states , and to those who have implemented the community programmes .
some deficits , though , still remain .
the galileo satellite programme is still underfunded , and there are – to say the least – question marks against the decisions on rural development and on voluntary modulation in agriculture policy .
we will be very vigilant in ensuring that the letter and spirit of all agreements are complied with .
i wish to express my gratitude to the austrian presidency , for our negotiations with it were constructive and fair .
the presidency can certainly not have had an easy job with so many opponents of reform in the council and in coreper .
i should like to conclude by expressing my deep gratitude to the commissioner with responsibility for budgets .
it is for this reason that i recommend that the house should vote to approve this agreement .
. – the opinion of the committee on constitutional affairs on the interinstitutional agreement is a positive one .
i wish to point out that the committee on constitutional affairs has been asked to deliver an opinion on the compatibility of the interinstitutional agreement with the treaties in force .
there is no legal obstacle to its adoption .
in this report , parliament emphasises that future financial frameworks should be set up for a five-year period , in line with the terms of office of parliament and the commission .
this in our view is a necessary step towards greater public scrutiny and democratic monitoring of the union ’ s budgetary options .
the compromise that has been reached between the parties does not live up to the vision and ambition shared by many members of parliament , myself included .
in spite of the difficulties , parliament was able to obtain this satisfactory compromise , which safeguards cohesion as a fundamental principle of the union and the priority attached to the lisbon strategy .
for parliament to give its public assent , it does not need to consider that the agreement reached is perfect .
the agreement on the review 2009 ensures that parliament will participate on an equal footing .
the review will cover all aspects of the union ’ s system of spending resources and will have to address the issue of the reform of own resources .
this key debate will benefit from the experience of implementing the agreement before us .
this interinstitutional agreement was negotiated under extremely difficult circumstances .
it is clearly a success and good news for europe , especially given the atmosphere of crisis surrounding projects and leadership that has beset europe in recent years .
thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to address your house on the subject of how our union is to be funded in future , and on the interinstitutional agreement .
we all know that the negotiations on the interinstitutional agreement were never a simple matter .
i can assure you that your house ’ s negotiating team did not give us an easy ride .
the result is one with which you will all be familiar , and so i would like just to sketch it out point by point ; there is a detailed description of it in mr böge ’ s report .
we know that there is no getting away from the fact that we will attach different values to results such as this one .
that is how it is with any and every compromise .
i believe that the result is fair and evenly balanced .
the mere fact that we have been able to achieve a result on a matter that is central to the european union is something i regard as a triumph in itself .
i believe that every institution has done exactly what its responsibilities demanded of it , and that the search for the best possible european solution brought forth a climate of cooperation .
on the other hand , though , we are deliberately prioritising those areas where there is a need for more growth , more jobs and a reduction in the number of unemployed , which is our common goal .
i have just three brief observations to make .
i think it would be right and proper for us to agree on a new part 3 of the interinstitutional agreement , dealing with the economic management of the eu ’ s funds .
secondly , there is the overall ceiling to consider .
we all know how very difficult it was to achieve consensus on this in the council in december , and that raising this ceiling was therefore a very difficult issue for the council .
i will conclude by saying that i have always been convinced that there can be only one common solution to the vital question of our joint financial arrangements and the agreement between the three institutions .
this is a fundamental issue for the eu , and division on it would have done the europe in which we share no good whatever .
our consensus is a demonstration of the fact that , together , we are capable of acting on behalf of this union of ours and sends an important message to our people .
the day before yesterday – 15 may – this interinstitutional agreement was approved by the general affairs council and i ask your house to join with us in giving it your approval and adopting it today .
again , i thank you for the good negotiations and for your willingness to allow me the time today to say what i have said .
i would like personally to thank the european parliament ’ s negotiating team , mr böge , mr lewandowski , mr mulder and mr walter , for the remarkable job they did .
their support and tight cooperation has brought great results .
i would also like to thank the minister for his untiring efforts to reach an agreement .
that was also very helpful .
we understand that this agreement does not reflect every area of our original ambitions , but it is the best possible compromise for today .
the way eu money is spent is at least as important as the level of expenditure .
in this respect i very much welcome the new commitments included in the iia as regards increasing the accountability of all financial actors , including the member states .
the agreement contains many positive elements , in particular the boost to the development of the new member states .
we increased funding for programmes directly related to the new lisbon agenda .
there are also new elements .
for the first time , the agreement entails a joint effort with the european investment bank .
those funds will help act as a catalyst for lisbon-related priorities .
finally , one should not forget the increased flexibility achieved through different instruments , to be mobilised where necessary for unforeseen events and needs .
again , let me thank all actors who participated in these negotiations , and i wish members a very good debate with a positive outcome .
. mr president , i wish to thank parliament 's team , who showed such respect and gave such commitment and importance to the committee on development 's position .
i must reflect a rather negative position from that committee : in june 2005 you will recall that this hemicycle was encircled by a ' make poverty history ' band .
how can we believe that it is possible for europe to meet its millennium development goal targets if resources are to be limited for those critical years up to 2013 ?
finally , our commitment is to fund human and social development in the world 's poorest countries .
as things stand , i think we tragically face the likelihood that europe will be seen as reneging on those principles and on those priorities .
. – mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we in the committee on foreign affairs have considered these questions , and there are two main points i would like to put before you .
one is that it is of the utmost importance that funds should be made available for the european union ’ s peacekeeping operations in the balkans and also in many other countries around the world .
there is now the prospect of an operation in the congo .
that the funding has been topped up is something to be welcomed , but we would prefer it not to be divided up .
the civilian component will be funded from the european union ’ s budget , and the rest provided by the member states from their current income .
this results in shadow budgets that are ever more difficult to monitor as a consequence of their no longer being subject to the full scrutiny of the national parliaments , or , indeed of the european parliament either .
this must surely be counted as a deficit .
i might add that it is also of paramount importance that we have discovered deficits in these overseas operations , specifically in connection with reconnaissance and telecommunications .
if we are to send troops on difficult missions , it is very important that it should first be ascertained what is going on on the ground , and for that we need satellite-based reconnaissance systems .
it is irresponsible to deploy troops with five or six different types of communications apparatus , which often work together only with difficulty or are not mutually compatible at all .
that is why we in the european union need a single satellite reconnaissance system and common standards for telecommunications in this sphere .
another reason why that is particularly important is that it is the very same deficits that are to be found among the police and in disaster prevention and management centres .
let us imagine europe being struck by a tsunami .
this is another important task for the budget of the european union .
. mr president , that i should wish to express my satisfaction with the outcome is hardly surprising , since i was on the negotiating team .
i would also like to take this opportunity of thanking my colleagues on the negotiating team , the commission and the austrian presidency .
i take the view that we have achieved as much as we could .
with regard to budgetary control , undoubtedly the most important thing is the fact that we have been given a clause in the agreement about better control on spending and certification .
after all , the court of auditors has been issuing negative statements of assurance for the past 11 years , and this is something that the european public will no longer accept from us .
last year , we stated for the first time that national statements should be introduced .
before the negotiations , 23 of the 25 member states were still opposed to the idea ; after the negotiations , they were all in favour .
i think it very important for the sake of the commission that we should , in future , hold firm to the idea that member states make those statements one way or another .
i happen to know that there are a few that have objected to this .
fortunately , this is not officially reflected in any way in the documents we are ratifying today , but it will cause a problem for the future .
it is important to this house that the commission implement this agreement as it was intended .
there are , of course , a number of drawbacks to this agreement .
indeed , it is impossible to please everybody all of the time .
for me , what poses the greatest risk is the council ’ s declaration in the area of voluntary modulation .
the common market for agricultural products is one of the things we have achieved in europe .
if we start with 20 % – or any other percentage – of voluntary modulation , then this strikes at the very root of the common agricultural policy .
that is very dangerous and something we must avoid .
if this house is to have any say in the matter , i will – for as long as i am still a member of it – try to prevent this from happening .
final agreement on the financial perspective provides , at long last , the political , economic and financial stability for these proposals to be actually put into effect .
it is not just the people in the new member states who are looking to the european union for support .
such matters as the crediting of vat , the n + 2 rule and the options available for public / private financing will in future be dealt with in the same way in each member state .
that is a triumph for this house and for its team in the negotiations , and warm thanks are therefore in order .
that is a huge decrease and comes on top of the reduction in the structural funds .
this is clearly going to result in more people leaving our rural areas and , indirectly , in the problems within our towns and suburbs becoming more acute .
the first pillar , for its part , is going to come under strong downwards pressure : compulsory and optional modulation , financial discipline , reform of the common organisations of the market and wto negotiation .
the 2003 agreements have therefore been completely disregarded , and the balance that was struck is being called into question before the 2008-2009 revision period is even looked at .
like mr mulder , i also want to stress that the optional modulation in these unconditional procedures resolves nothing .
as far as i am concerned , this is the start of a renationalisation of the cap ; i will therefore vote against this agreement .
i would like finally to congratulate our rapporteur , mr böge , on his excellent work , and i also believe that the temporary committee has done very good work .
let me give you just two examples to show why i am talking about the number of young people and not just about the financial aspects .
the cut made to leonardo – the training programme – was from 150 000 to 36 000 .
from the very start of the negotiation process , the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs made four precise demands .
we obtained that sub-heading : it is sub-heading 3a .
we obtained that increase in appropriations .
during the next seven years , it will be possible to increase the appropriations allocated to the creation of the area of freedom , security and justice by 167 % – yes , 167 % .
that is by far the strongest potential growth of the new financial framework .
thirdly , we requested authorisation to finance the new agencies by means other than the financial framework , so as to preserve the resources dedicated to the operational programmes .
this financing will therefore not be automatically covered by the financial perspective .
we can be satisfied with this , even if we had hoped for something better .
admittedly , this arrangement does not appear as such in the text of the interinstitutional agreement , but rather as a unilateral declaration by the european parliament : it is declaration 13 .
nevertheless , the council ’ s tight-fistedness and short-sightedness , arising out of national considerations , have triumphed over parliament ’ s and the commission ’ s european ambition .
we will nevertheless be voting in favour of this interinstitutional agreement , since it is the only compromise possible under the current circumstances .
indeed , the lack of financial perspectives in the next few years would plunge the union into an even deeper crisis than the one it is already in .
moreover , it would not be fair on the new member states , for they need future prospects in order to continue their cohesion policy and to be fully integrated into the common market .
this does not alter the fact that the present level of resources is insufficient to meet europe ’ s new challenges .
that is why the review clause and flexibility scheme were an absolute necessity , because the risk that sooner or later , we will run aground , is too great .
parliament should be fully involved in this .
the most important conclusion we can draw , though , is that the current system of own resources has reached capacity levels .
there is a need for sweeping reform .
we must move away from the system of donations from national budgets , and return to real own resources as was the case at the start of european integration in respect of customs rights .
that is the only way of ensuring that the european general interest will prevail over the narrow-minded and short-sighted national interest .
this house must play a role – a driving role – in this and formulate proposals , and mr lamassoure ’ s studies and notes are a good place to start .
we have therefore made sure that budgeting will be done in a more structured way in future and that the money can actually be made use of .
secondly , we have made sure of sufficient flexibility in the budget for new things .
we have also managed to get more money for health and consumer protection , for cross-frontier cooperation and in many other areas .
let me say in conclusion that this compromise may well not be the stuff of my dreams , but i wholeheartedly endorse it , and ask my fellow members of this house to approve it .
mr president , commissioner , mr president-in-office of the council , reaching the agreement on budgetary discipline has been a long haul .
in parliament , we have done some thorough work , analysing what is needed and developing common political priorities .
we have done this in the course of more than a year under the expert leadership of our rapporteur , mr böge , whose efforts have been exemplary .
the compromise we are debating today really is , therefore , a compromise .
it is not a particularly attractive one , and no one is fully satisfied with it .
rather , it is the art of the possible .
the optimist in us will , however , emphasise that it is constructive that there is now a framework to facilitate the legislative work on the programmes for the structural funds , research and education .
what is more , the framework provides more resources for investment in education , research and transport and for aid to the eu ’ s poor regions , while expenditure on agricultural aid is cut back .
i therefore recommend voting in favour of the agreement .
we have ensured that administration of the eu budget will become less bureaucratic .
we have ensured that responsibility for administering eu resources has been placed squarely with the member states .
we have ensured that the european investment bank is able to provide far more ambitious funding and that more young people are able to take part in educational exchange programmes .
we have also ensured that the eu budget for health and consumer protection was not subject to the swingeing cutbacks planned by the heads of state or government .
the framework is tight , however ; so tight that it pinches .
the commission proposed eur 20 billion by way of investment in cross-border transport projects .
parliament supported the commission , but the result has only been eur 7 billion .
how are we to obtain money for the 30 cross-border projects that have been adopted ?
i think that the council owes us an answer regarding how the common projects can be made a reality .
it is for that reason that my criticisms are primarily directed at the council .
what we are dealing with at the moment is a nationalistic deformation of europe ’ s foundations that is detrimental to every plan we make for the future .
contrary to what previous speakers have said about there being no alternative , we do believe that one would have been possible .
we could of course have gone back to the annual budget procedure , and we in this house would have had 30 billion more with which we would have been able to do something about our own priorities .
let us consider the messages that are being sent out .
over recent years , parliament and the commission have acted very responsibly , and have done so out of a sense of responsibility to europe .
what can we in europe do better than the nation states on their own ?
that is what we need to concentrate on ; that is what will win the european people over , but what has happened now ?
we have a structurally conservative budget that keeps agricultural policy as it was and makes no attempt to transfer funds to rural development .
just as before , agricultural export subsidies are in place , ruining , among other things , the development of african markets and contributing to the refugee problems about which we are always complaining .
this is where the european union ’ s policies are wrong , and i find it very regrettable that there has been no change in this respect and that the council has stonewalled in this way .
even that compromise is no kind of triumph , but rather no more than a drop in the ocean .
we have succeeded in doing none of those things and must therefore come to the conclusion that this budget is quite simply not forward-looking enough .
the council stood in the way of much of it , and that is why we cannot go along with it .
the last thing i want to say is that i am very grateful to the negotiating team and to mr böge for the dedication with which they handled the proceedings .
we will have no shortage of work to do in the coming weeks and months .
. mr president , commissioner , on behalf of my group i wish to thank the rapporteur , mr böge , for the work he has done with regard to the matter now before us .
it is not his fault that the council keelhauled the commission and parliament and bruised the political credibility of these institutions .
the biggest miscalculation was made by the commission in its original proposal for economic guidelines .
it miscalculated the council ’ s relative powers and created expectations that were far too great .
the report by parliament ’ s temporary committee was produced on the basis of these expectations .
it was difficult for many members to come to terms with mr böge ’ s sense of realism at the time .
while the council was editing the commission ’ s proposal , the commission continued to create expectations that were too high .
president barroso marketed the commission ’ s view on the basis of total miscalculations .
he has lost face in this process , as has parliament as a whole .
parliament ’ s decision to reject the conclusions drawn by the council in december 2005 at the time established a good basis for further talks .
the council , however , showed the commission and parliament that the eu ’ s money came from the member states .
the commission and parliament may in practice only be involved in decision-making relating to the eu ’ s expenditure : in the redistribution of cash within the framework dictated by the council .
postponing resolution of the problems until the mid-term review at the end of 2009 will not increase parliament ’ s power in eu budgetary matters .
on the revenues side , we have failed to get rid of the unjustified uk special rebate .
my group would have liked a more constructive budgetary framework for the period 2007 – 2013 .
this we have not got , and we are voting against the adoption of mr böge ’ s report .
we have not achieved the sort of flexibility in the financial framework that would have been necessary for good financial management .
instead , the member states are putting more money in the budget for the militarisation of the eu .
the council has cleverly exploited a situation in which the federalists in the commission and parliament will not be able to cope with a new eu-wide crisis .
. mr president , as far as the new financial perspective is concerned , we are definitely faced with both bad news and good news .
the good news is that we have overcome the 10-month impasse in talks on the issue , and that the multiannual planning of the european union ’ s finances now has a solid basis .
it is also good that this basis is eur 4 billion higher than the council ’ s proposal .
the bad news is that the net contributors are still continuing to place restrictions on the union ’ s development by means of spending cuts .
this review may thus be understood to be an attempt to enforce budgetary discipline and another reason for spending cuts .
it is therefore good that we have the new financial perspective , but bad that it demonstrates so little economic solidarity and such little will to meet external challenges .
it would be in the interests of the european union as a whole for the net contributors to contribute more generously .
they would then reap the overall benefits from a higher growth rate in the beneficiary member states .
the competitiveness of the european union will not increase if we continue to defend an outdated social model and expensive jobs .
in this matter , blaming the new member states or enlargement will not help .
the union ’ s economic problems have deeper roots , quite aside from political problems resulting from unfair and irresponsible comments directed at the governments of certain member states .
– ladies and gentlemen , in the agreement , we are preparing to introduce a protective mechanism known as the european globalisation adjustment fund , and to invest eur 3.5 billion in it .
i am fundamentally opposed to this .
i strongly believe that in a further populist move , we are handing out fish where we should be learning how to catch fish ourselves .
the globalisation fund does not have the objective of creating new jobs in sectors with long-term opportunities .
it is seeking something entirely different .
it is seeking to support those who lose work as a consequence of companies escaping from the tight reins of the eu .
instead of abolishing directives , opening up the market for services and labour and cutting taxes , we are currying favour with the citizens with a pipe dream of short-term social gain .
does anybody in this chamber really think that greater support for the unemployed would lead to the creation of new jobs ?
furthermore , with the establishment of the fund we are creating a completely false impression that it is possible to protect the eu from the rest of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , just as we do not control the wind or the rain , we do not have the power to stop capital from running away to a place where it feels better .
we should keep that in mind .
mr president , the final agreement on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 coincided with the second anniversary of the enlargement of the european union , and thus constitutes a birthday present of sorts .
it is also real proof that the european union is functioning with 25 member states .
this is proof in a field where compromise is difficult , as differences are sharply delineated and calculable in financial terms .
the financial agreement and the agreement on financial principles leave us here in parliament in doubt as to whether we have sufficient funds to achieve the stated political aims of the european union .
the rural development fund is an example and symbol of just such a case .
the budget needs changes , but it does not require a revolution .
it cannot be an alternative means of reforming the european union .
public spending cannot replace the far-reaching reforms needed to make the union competitive .
i would like to thank all those who took part in this venture , which has now been brought to a successful close .
– mr president , the majority of my group is going to vote in favour of the agreement on the financial perspective 2007-2013 , reflecting our sense of responsibility .
i believe these to be the fundamental reasons for our vote in favour .
nevertheless , given our desire to move ahead with the construction of an increasingly strong , fair and cooperative europe , we have serious doubts about whether it is appropriate to vote in favour .
so far everybody has gained from it .
there are no net contributors ; that hackneyed notion is merely a fallacy dreamt up by bad accountants .
representatives of the council , this time we are going to give our approval , but we will be watching to see what happens next .
as any document shows , we are talking about a review in 2009 .
if you do not propose valid solutions for the union very soon , we will have to impose them ourselves .
mr president , first i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr böge , for his excellent work towards establishing the financial frameworks .
he was working under difficult circumstances , but nevertheless enjoyed parliament ’ s undivided confidence throughout .
the financial framework is a shallow one , payments only account for 1 % of gross national income , and it is visible within the content of the frameworks .
it is unfortunate that we could not do anything about great britain ’ s annual eur five-and-a-half billion contribution rebate .
in my opinion every one of us should bear responsibility for financing the eu .
initially the emphasis in the financial frameworks was on improved competitiveness .
the commission set an ambitious objective to improve industrial and entrepreneurial competitiveness in the european union by promoting research and development and endorsing training schemes .
the funds intended for these were to be trebled within seven years .
the purpose was to improve employment prospects in particular .
the council , however , cut these funds by 40 % , so this ambitious objective remained unachieved , which has been the greatest failure in these negotiations on the financial framework .
it is good in the final outcome that progress has been made with the structural funds .
the new member states are to receive approximately eur 24 billion net every year from the old member states for their reconstruction .
in this way europe can once again become united and strong .
now we need to hurry to make use of the time available to establish the financial programmes , otherwise unpaid commitments will reach intolerable levels in the first few years .
we should try to cope with this crisis of confidence through the sort of policies , results and reforms that restore public confidence .
it sometimes happens that the moment of truth arrives earlier than one thought it would .
there is something spooky afoot when the president of the council talks about a fair and balanced budget .
it is in a state of affairs such as that that you are proposing , in all seriousness , to win back the trust of europe ’ s citizens .
that is a recipe for disappointed public expectations ; the worsening of the crisis is built in .
you cannot leave the text and the context unchanged .
– the agreement reached for the financial framework for 2007-2013 , including the interinstitutional agreement , is a bad agreement .
it is inadequate from a financial point of view and as regards its priorities and its instruments for addressing the challenges facing an enlarged union .
it is an agreement that fails to respond to the increased needs of cohesion , and to attach priority to fighting the increased imbalance , inequality , unemployment and poverty in the eu .
it is a bad agreement for economic and social cohesion and for cohesion countries , insofar as it relegates the community budget ’ s role of redistribution .
it is an agreement that is eur 100 billion down on parliament ’ s original proposal .
it is also a bad agreement for countries like portugal .
consequently , we have no choice but to reject this agreement .
– mr president , can the union be competitive when it creates regulations that weaken it ?
these kinds of regulations are created in almost all fields .
they make it impossible for the new member states to catch up with the richer member states .
instead of creating a strong european union in line with the treaties , decisions are being made that cement its division into two parts ; more to the rich and less to the poor .
i would like to ask you to look carefully at the figures in the budgets following the last enlargement and see how hugely disproportionate they are and how they discriminate against the new member states .
this lack of proportion runs counter to common sense and also harms the interests of the old member states of the union , as is mentioned in the most recent report of the centre for european reform .
it indicates that the old member states would benefit more if the new member states received more support .
this would stimulate the economy and the market , and a larger market produces greater benefits .
a narrow understanding of the interests of the old union threatens the cohesion of the whole european union .
we will not achieve a better future for europe if this policy continues .
it will be very difficult , if not impossible , to implement the enlargement of the union , increase growth and achieve deeper integration with smaller financial means than we have hitherto had at our disposal .
we must listen when some people call for greater transparency in european decision-making , for example the publishing of funding awards , so that people know who has actually benefited .
this is european taxpayers ’ money that we are talking about . ’
i am sure that you , mr grasser , can agree with that .
now , though , what has become of publications by the ministry of finance ?
so just do it at last ; pay no heed to those who whisper lies in your ear , and do not succumb to the deceitful intoxication of power .
mr president , the european parliament put its full trust in mr böge to negotiate an acceptable financial perspective package for the european union .
the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management , which will be put to the vote today , provides for great advances in the field of budgetary discipline and parliament ’ s budgetary rights .
the question is whether these improvements are going to compensate for the serious deficits that exist in relation to figures .
the european parliament ’ s negotiating position expressed in the resolution of june 2004 was the last compromise that was truly acceptable to the political groups and we therefore approved it unanimously .
on that basis , the european parliament and our rapporteur embarked upon an impossible battle : to raise the figures to acceptable levels in order to maintain a positive impetus within the union and its programmes .
surprisingly , the head of the governments which will suffer most from this reduction , mine in particular , did not do much to prevent that failure .
the final decision is in the hand of the parliamentary groups and the national delegations , which in any event will draw whichever conclusions they consider most positive for the future of the union .
the majority of my group is going to vote in favour of this financial perspective .
had it not been for him , the agreement would have been much worse .
mr president , the treaty provides only for an annual budgetary procedure .
it does not provide for financial perspectives .
but it is nonetheless quite sensible that the two arms of the budgetary authority agree on a multiannual perspective to permit more sensible long-term and forward planning .
that said , in terms of overall content it is a good agreement .
many colleagues have pointed out that the sums agreed are less than what had initially been proposed by the commission .
that , of course , is true .
at the same time , however , for most items of expenditure they represent an increase on current levels of eu spending .
sometimes the increases are substantial , as in the case of research and development .
the one area that will decline is agricultural spending , by about 7 % over that whole period .
it may not seem much of a decline , but not just the 10 new member states but also romania and bulgaria will have to fit within that ceiling .
that would mean a substantial decrease for the old eu-15 .
i think the reform of the cap in this regard has often been underestimated in the debate .
the redistribution from agriculture to other items of expenditure is something that should be welcomed .
one of the ways the member state governments could stimulate the private initiative is to create an environment conducive to the growth of high quality economy .
we must ask ourselves whether the interinstitutional agreement reached will contribute to the attainment of this objective .
we can hardly answer this question because initially the agreement was reached when the member states shared opinions at the dinner table and decided which programmes should be funded .
later the european parliament joined the dinner table and attempted to adjust the agreement with regard to priorities defined by social programmes .
can we really assess the economic impact of an agreement reached in this way ?
therefore , i believe the procedures for developing such projects should be regulated in a more strict and clear-cut way .
first of all we must clearly define the responsibility of the member states in respect of the general budget , that is , reform the own resources system .
the commission should say clearly that it supports this proposal and should say what it proposes and what it is doing , because at the moment there is a lot of uncertainty in this matter .
the second important task is to actually define the criteria for each programme underlying the fund ’ s allocation .
at present these criteria are of a very general character , on occasions overlap , and it is utterly unclear whether the funds , seemingly considerable amounts , will actually benefit the european citizens .
mr president , it is said that a bad compromise leaves some people happy and some people sad , while a good compromise leaves everybody pretty well unsatisfied .
it would appear , to my group at least , that according to that definition this is a very good compromise .
the question for my group , however , is whether this interinstitutional agreement answers the big questions facing europe at the moment .
our judgement is that it does not .
it looks increasingly clear that we are in a minority , but we will be voting against this deal on the grounds that we could do so much better for our citizens .
we are not without ideas .
the sapir report contained a number of ideas that merited consideration .
they have been put to one side in favour of continuing as we are , when europe deserves so much better .
on those grounds , my group will be voting against .
nonetheless , we disagree with it in essence .
this agreement is particularly inadequate from the point of view of financial resources .
for example , the last enlargement increased the gdp of the european union and hence its revenue by 5 % ; at the same time , however , it increased its population by 30 % .
this means that expenditure will increase more than revenue , especially if account is taken of the fact that most of the new member states have a much lower per capita income than the rest .
despite all this , the budget in absolute numbers is not very different from today 's levels .
similarly , the agreement is inadequate from the point of view of priorities for meeting the economic , social and environmental challenges of an enlarged european union .
it does not reflect the cohesion requirements of the current enlargement .
mr president , budgetary discipline , sound financial management – surely these words are alien to this place !
in fact , they are veritable oxymorons when used in relation to anything to do with the finances of the european union .
this agreement is designed to keep the whole crumbling edifice of the eu in place .
it uses lots of high-sounding words that give the impression that the eu is professional , well organised and has properly-maintained financial records .
all i can say to that is ‘ phooey ’ .
words mean nothing .
after 11 years of abject failure to produce auditable financial accounts , how can we possibly justify putting in place an agreement allowing more of the same ?
my colleagues and i will therefore be voting against this agreement on principle , but then we do not believe in the european union either .
it is a morally bankrupt , institutionally wrong and dangerously undemocratic organisation , a dinosaur in the modern world .
it is a major threat to security , freedom and , more importantly , the economic future of europe .
– the fact that we have reached an agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management , as well as an agreement on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 is a definite step forwards .
however , neither the points of conflict nor the stop-gap measures used to agree the annual budget and the financial perspective of the eu have been ironed out .
we will have to continue patiently to seek forms of regular communication , at least between the council and parliament .
in other words , we will have to continue to intensify communication between meps and the national parliaments and governments .
it is a far more complex and urgent matter , however to reform the individual structures of the eu as items of budgetary finance .
one way out could be a gradual move towards supporting and increasing funding for the construction of trans-european networks .
this would create the preconditions for a growth in europe ’ s global competitiveness , and the european parliament , in guaranteeing national activities of this kind , would undoubtedly enhance its political prestige .
mr president , i too want personally to thank the rapporteur , mr böge , for his excellent work .
it is pertinent to remark that none of us could have dealt with this matter better , in what were extremely difficult negotiations .
he managed to improve on the original proposal in two matters especially .
the first of these is the flexibility instrument .
this is an important tool , because responding in humanitarian situations is precisely what the public expects of the eu .
the other important matter is the review clause in the financial perspectives , which is an absolutely essential instrument from the point of view of parliament ’ s competence .
i must express my disappointment with the council ’ s original agreement and , in particular , with christmas bonuses .
they will not bring any kind of added value to the eu , and the emphasis should have been on training and innovation .
the galileo and erasmus programmes should have warranted better treatment and additional funding .
it is nevertheless important that consensus has been reached and that we can show our citizens that in the new eu of 25 countries decisions can be made even in difficult circumstances .
accordingly , it is extremely important for us all to vote in favour of mr böge ’ s report .
once again i say thank you to mr böge for the excellent job he has done .
as new european citizens with full rights , we understood that the 2007-2013 financial perspective has to serve a better , globally more competitive europe .
as a member of the committee on regional development , i should like to emphasise one point .
with the structural funds for the 2007-2013 period , we can achieve this same result insofar as the new member states , in particular , will be able to use the funds made available to them .
mr president , the european parliament is now entering into a compromise with the council of ministers concerning the half-witted budget for the next seven years .
more than a third of eu money goes officially to agriculture , but it does not reach the farmers .
danish farmers ’ total net income for agriculture is only a quarter of the direct subsidy .
that is madness .
farmers could obtain four times more by way of total net income if the various arrangements were circumvented and the money sent to farmers directly .
another third goes officially to regional development and the structural funds .
the reality is that poor people in distant regions are direct net contributors to the eu budget .
in latvia , 80 % of eu aid goes to riga .
poor people living in the countryside pay a large contribution to the eu via their daily purchases , but the money is not returned by the eu to those who pay .
it is robin hood in reverse , with the eu taking from the poor and giving to the rich .
instead , allow the new countries not to have to pay contributions .
begin rearranging the budget now by voting against the compromise on funding .
the council has also – to all intents and purposes – allocated more powers to parliament by making it possible for the latter to assess the budget ’ s structure in 2008-2009 .
we are still in what is termed the period of reflection about the eu ’ s future .
a period of reflection can , and indeed should , also offer the opportunity of calling a few things into question .
for example , we seem to be moving towards a european tax in the form of a tax on energy and transport .
the fact is , half of the member states are in serious deficit and the other half do not see why they should pay on behalf of mismanaged countries .
the time has therefore come to reform the system of resources that sustain the european budget .
our parliament is working on practical proposals , and we have been doing so with the help of the national parliaments for nearly a year .
last week ’ s interparliamentary conference made it possible to hold an initial , encouraging debate on the diagnosis , schedule and scope of the reform .
the diagnosis is virtually unanimous .
the current system is regarded everywhere as anti-eu , unjust and totally incomprehensible to europeans .
as regards the schedule , the consensus is that the 2008-2009 meeting must be used as an opportunity to reach a political agreement on the practical arrangements for a reform .
as regards the scope , opinion remains very divided .
there are the masochists who suffer as a result of the system , but who like to suffer .
there are the moderates , who want to retain the principles of the current system .
there are the ambitious ones , who are more open to more radical changes .
a further meeting is scheduled with the national parliaments ’ committees on budgets for 21 june .
our aim is to succeed at least in bringing the points of view close enough together so that the commission might take its inspiration from the proposals put to it for 2008 .
– mr president , i would like to follow mr lamassoure in concentrating on the reform of the financing system .
the one we have at present is unworkable , unfair , lacking in transparency and is no longer sustainable .
one of the things we regard as essential is that this house should be involved in the 2008 / 2009 reform process .
i am grateful to those who have negotiated on our behalf .
there would be a closer connection between policies and the means by which they are funded , and so better democratic control and greater transparency would be possible .
it is good that item 4 makes preparatory arrangements for that event .
thank you , mr böge ; thank you , mr sousa pinto .
the proposals presented by our parliament in june 2005 enabled this ambitious policy to materialise .
that is why , albeit with a slightly heavy heart , i will be voting in favour of this compromise because , no matter what happens , i want europe to continue to make progress .
when the path is narrow and steep , it is better to move forward in small steps than not to move forward at all .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , today ’ s vote at the european parliament will adopt the interinstitutional agreement reached on the financial framework for the 2007-2013 period .
this will be one of the most significant and far-reaching votes in this part-session .
the interinstitutional agreement reached provides for a sum of eur 864 billion for the next financial framework , or 1.05 % of the european union ’ s total national revenue .
the compromise reached , however , has various positive features .
firstly , there is the flexible approach to setting a ceiling on amounts to be received from eu funds , as advocated by the european parliament in its resolution .
secondly , there is the calculation of the ceilings , using each member state ’ s individual economic growth forecast .
thirdly , there is the agreement to allow the use of structural funds resources for accommodation projects .
the limit of 2 % of total structural funds resources , which is identical for all the new member states , is , however , difficult to understand .
for example , it is obvious that heating homes is a much more urgent issue in countries with a harsher climate , such as estonia and latvia , than in southern countries such as cyprus and malta .
therefore , this unified approach is unjustified .
fourthly , there is the gradual replacement of the n + 2 rule with the n + 3 rule .
of course , the application of such a rule to the cohesion fund is still open to doubt .
– mr president , i keep on hearing today that we are supposed to be approving a compromise .
as the previous speaker mentioned , we are facing a backward movement in policies at national level .
all you need to do is flick through the newspapers .
yesterday morning ’ s headline in the austrian was ‘ eu fails to meet its own education targets ’ .
there are six million young people leaving school without qualifications , and , on top of that , the figures for lifelong learning are 42 % down on what parliament proposed .
it is quite clear from this that things are out of joint .
assuming we get a majority this lunchtime , we will be assuming joint responsibility for a budget on which we have not made our mark .
that is what the directly-elected european parliament has managed to do with a budget like this one .
it is not enough ; the glass is not half full – it is empty .
that is why i hope that many members of this house will refuse to give their endorsement to this financial perspective .
negotiations with this house ’ s delegation made it quite clear what is at stake here , and what we have achieved together is a great triumph .
there is just one issue i want to highlight and that is the great european disease of ‘ agencyolism ’ – the compulsion to keep on creating new agencies .
we have now taken that function out of the council ’ s hands ; under the interinstitutional agreement , parliament ’ s consent is always required .
we are now the doctors who can grapple with this sickness within the council , and we should take the use of these instruments very seriously .
i believe that by doing so , we will add more european value than if we were to leave it in the hands of the council and its secretive meetings .
mr president , may i add my congratulations to mr berger and the parliament team , particularly mr walter .
they all worked very hard through difficult and drawn-out negotiations to achieve this agreement .
i firmly believe that , given the circumstances , the best and most sensible deal was brokered .
parliament was right to push member states to put more resources behind the ambitious programmes that all the governments and political leaders have signed up to .
but , more importantly , the negotiations have had key outcomes , non-financial gains that add value and will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of future budgets .
the best course of action for now is to focus on this 2008 budgetary review .
in it we must reform the structure of the budget from head to toe – deconstruct it to build a new improved framework that reflects the needs and expectations of the eu of 2014 .
i therefore urge the commission not to miss the boat again .
now we must build an eu financial framework that demonstrates transparency , one that is rigorous and displays solidarity .
it has to be free from the legacies of the past ; a framework that must combine the visions of over 27 member states and is flexible enough to face future challenges .
mr president , mr grasser , mrs grybauskaitė , i should like to begin by addressing my colleague , mr böge , and sincerely thanking him for his outstanding work .
unfortunately , we are faced with a minimum interinstitutional agreement .
young people must benefit from more erasmus scholarships , but we note that there is not an adequate budget for this .
the council declares that we need more europe if we are to sustain regional funding , but does not want to commit itself on the matter .
this deceptive policy makes people believe in the union having its own sources of finance , but any notion of a european tax would mean europe being severely criticised .
nevertheless , this budget does focus somewhat on research and on the european transport networks , such as the lyon-turin project .
yet , what have become of the ambitions for galileo as a result ?
where are the funds that were supposed to encourage our smes to set up in international markets ?
what have you done with the rural development fund ?
this is the budget of hypocrisy .
under these circumstances , i will vote in favour of this minimum agreement because i am genuinely obliged to do so , but it will be with a heavy heart that i give you my vote .
mr president , the interinstitutional agreement contains a proposal to review the financial framework in 2008 / 2009 .
this is a step in the right direction , but only if the european parliament is involved in this task , and under the best possible conditions .
a further issue is that the future financial framework must be established for a five-year period .
each successive parliament and each commission must have the right to vote on the financial priorities of their term .
it is , therefore , a positive sign that the european constitution wants to change that .
in article 402 it proposes that the multiannual financial framework should be established for a period of – and i quote – ‘ at least five years ’ .
to conclude , i would like to say that we all want a financial system which will be fair to both the old and the new members of the european union .
we want a system that will be transparent and that will give the eu an opportunity to fulfil its aims by using its own resources rather than by using the financial contributions of the member states .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the speeches made by my fellow members highlight the great difficulties we are having in moving away from the ‘ glass-half-empty or half-full ’ attitude .
many members have seen the glass as ‘ half-full ' ; many others have seen it as half-empty .
yet , what is the one significant political action , aside from the partial results on each budget chapter , that makes us realise that this is a good result ?
i believe that it is a political result , in the sense that parliament has shown itself to be active and capable of relaunching an intergovernmental decision and of turning it into a decision with a european outlook .
we owe our gratitude for this both to mr böge and the negotiating team and to all those who have demonstrated that they are constructively concerned about the future of a generation .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , voting in favour of this financial perspective would mean going back on one ’ s decision and not providing europe with the resources for its ambitions .
today , the same people are preparing to vote in favour of the financial perspective , which has been slashed by eur 110 billion .
would you believe it ?
i challenge anyone to understand that .
it is now that the european parliament must confirm that it is the driving force behind european life .
we would probably have enjoyed greater short-term popularity in the eyes of very many observers if we had said ‘ no ’ .
those are the questions that we – every one of us – must ask ourselves today .
– mr president , the compromise by the european council on the financial perspectives was inconsistent with the needs of the peoples of europe and the objectives of the european union .
it has , unfortunately , retained the 1 % doctrine which pins the budget of the enlarged europe of the 25 at the level of the budget of the union of the 15 member states .
it is clear , however , that – within the framework set from the beginning by the governments – the mindset which prevails in the council is a short-term , restrictive , accounting and administrative mindset .
the question therefore raised today goes beyond the debate on the future budget .
it relates to the very credibility of europe in the eyes of the citizens .
today a different european strategy is needed which will effectively promote development , employment , solidarity and social cohesion without discrimination but with prospects .
– mr president , mr böge deserves warm congratulations on his contribution .
the böge report also helps to improve the quality of the implementation of the budget : internal control , the facility to transfer appropriations using the flexibility instrument and legislative flexibility .
mainly , however , we secured the 2009 review with our full involvement in the review process .
where possible , mr böge reconciled our political priorities with the union 's financial requirements .
however , all together , with our systematic work in the committee on budgets , we basically achieved something else .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the agreement that has been reached is not the one that we would have hoped for , despite the fact that parliament fought with dignity for a more satisfactory budget .
if progress has been made – and it has – it is only thanks to parliament , its negotiating team and the rapporteur .
the council must assume full responsibility before europeans for a short-sighted and miserly outlook , which is concerned only with balancing the books of the national budgets and not with making europe great and powerful .
we are satisfied , however , because the agreement provides a number of positive solutions and confirms that the programmes will start on 1 january 2007 .
the thorny issue of reforming the financing of the budget remains unresolved .
we need a thorough reform of the structure and procedures , which is divorced from the mercantile ‘ give and take ’ approach and inspired by genuine pro-european ideas .
no public institution has lasted for long without having a direct link with its citizens through taxation .
mr president , recently the european union has experienced a number of significant defeats , the greatest being the rejection by certain countries of the constitutional treaty .
the consequences of this are being felt ever more painfully .
have we learnt nothing ?
should the period of reflection not spur us on to take a more critical view of our union ?
judging by the financial perspective being discussed today , this has not happened .
in spite of the interinstitutional agreement which has been concluded , and which we know is the best possible solution , the european council does not understand the needs of the union .
we are supposedly the citizens of the same countries , but we have such a different view of our needs .
could it be that the statesmen who represent our countries want to create political capital through financial limitations ?
have they achieved this ?
judging by some of them , perhaps not , but it does give us food for thought .
we should think about whether the effects of this financial perspective , which is not satisfactory for either side , will be as keenly felt in two years as the lack of the constitutional treaty .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i rejoice in this brief opportunity to reflect once more on the debate , and there are just two points that i would like to consider .
certain members of your house who negotiated with us – mr mulder and mr walter among them – have said that your house believes it has succeeded in getting the most out that it could .
would that – as someone said – have been something that would win us back the confidence of the public ?
what would have been the result of that ?
together , we have found the best possible solution for europe , and that was what we were tasked to do .
it is vital that our taxpayers , europe ’ s citizens , should be able to see that we are careful with money , that we conceal nothing and that we are trying to prevent abuses .
this is our unconditional commitment to them that the council , too , wants to improve monitoring .
so let me once again extend the warmest of thanks to your house 's negotiating team and to the commissioner and her own team , while also asking you to give your approval to this compromise .
we can say that we reached the point where historic events can happen .
today is a historic day for the chamber , a historic day for the enlarged europe .
it is also a historic day for the presidency , which can say : ' if you support this agreement , the presidency has been very successful ' .
i would like to invite you to vote positively today , to send a message to europeans that europe can be safe , can be financed and can start to work .
today , this decision is in your hands .
mr president , the new financial perspective is a compromise .
is it a good compromise ?
some earlier proposals would doubtless have been better for europe and its future .
financially speaking , the european union is not as strong as it could have been if we had managed to reach a consensus on a larger budget .
in polish there is a saying that ‘ if you do not get what you like , you have to like what you get ’ .
today it seems that this compromise is a success .
however , we will only find out after 2013 whether it will be viewed as equally successful in the future .
it is difficult to reach a universal consensus with regard to basic budget priorities .
i am convinced that an important dimension of european solidarity is practical solidarity in the form of cohesion policy .
the quality of the implementation of this financial perspective will determine whether the european union ’ s biggest enlargement to date , in 2004 , will be fully exploited and completed .
europe will be greater and more powerful at a relatively low price .
the union of 27 will have a smaller relative budget for 2007-2013 than that of the europe of 15 .
the rigour imposed on the national budgets did not permit an increase in national contributions , which explains why meps gave their approval to this compromise .
this budget , which is unjust and complex and which no longer makes it possible to finance future policies , must be reformed .
a form of financing based on own resources must be adopted , with the latter being fixed so as to provide the eu with full budgetary autonomy .
these resources would be equitable , transparent , controlled by democratic procedures and in compliance with the principle of cost neutrality .
the european parliament has succeeded in adopting a budget that reconciles political priorities with financial constraints , and in updating its structure and improving the way in which it is executed .
it is as partners that we have resolved this crisis .
parliament has not merely bared its teeth , but has put forward simple and practical ideas and suggestions .
i am particularly glad that we have made provision for the costs of enlargement .
this should be a lesson to us to do this better in future .
our original intention was to sort out practical projects in order to restore public confidence in us .
this , too , is a most significant step forward .
we will continue down this road in the remaining weeks that are left to the austrian presidency .
i hope that you will be cooperative and rely on your being so .
we will meet again in june , when we will be discussing the future of europe .
i wish you all the best , and thank you from the bottom of my heart .
the commission does not wish to speak , but i believe that it is essential for parliament , via its president , to supplement the words of the other budgetary authority .
this is certainly a minimal agreement , but it allows the union to function and does not add any further problems to the ones we already have .
parliament would like to thank you , mr böge — you and all of your negotiating team — for the work you have done on its behalf .
nevertheless , this maximum represents a minimum in terms of many of the union 's expressed ambitions .
in accordance with the financial perspective , the european union costs eur 0.72 per day for each european .
surely that is not excessive , given what the union achieves .
president papoulias , our parliament welcomes you today as a man of peace and a person committed to european integration .
i would like to highlight certain aspects of your personality , firstly pointing out that the two great political families in greece have been united in elevating you to the top office of state .
it is rare for all political parties to support one great personality .
the fact that you have the support of the whole political spectrum demonstrates that you are recognised as a man of moderation , of ethical responsibility and of prudence .
in fact , in greece you are thought of as the ‘ personification of prudence ’ .
it is also a recognition of your ceaseless quest for peace along the borders of your country with your most immediate neighbours , in the balkans and also in the middle east .
mr president , you were born in ioannina , the capital of a beautiful region , as anybody who has been lucky enough to visit it will confirm .
this must also be a source of inspiration at this difficult time for europe .
something that i am sure nobody knows , or few people know , is that the president of the hellenic republic visiting us today was a pole-vaulting champion in his youth .
there is no question that europe needs good pole-vaulters .
because its members are elected directly , the european parliament has the best possible credentials from the citizens of europe and the clearest instructions to express their concerns and problems .
i should like to start with a personal comment : coming from the generation that suffered under nazism , i experienced the second world war first hand .
this experience determined the start of the european way , an historic process with the attributes of a peace plan .
out of the ruins of war there was born the hope and the vision of a brotherhood of the peoples of europe .
this is an historic achievement which constitutes a model of stability in the global system .
the implementation of the european vision , which is still under way , is inevitably affected by international political and economic events .
it is a state of affairs on which the citizens of europe need to take an honest stand .
while preparing the speech i am giving today , i browsed through the electronic dialogue with the citizens of europe on the european union 's website .
i read interesting views , mainly from people living in different countries , but who have the same concerns .
the conclusion which i drew from this exercise is that the european union is being called upon today to return to the principles of european enlightenment that inspired its beginnings .
freedom , equality and humanity are the high ideals which determine the content of the european idea and which need to be given meaning again today .
freedom is now a concept which is examined in conjunction with that of security .
the citizens of europe and everyone living in europe do not want to feel threatened in a world suffering under international terrorism .
at the same time , however , they reject compromises on the protection of individual rights and personal freedoms .
we defend the doctrine of ' security and freedom ' , but not of ' security instead of freedom ' .
equality is defined differently depending on the point of view from which you view the world .
immigrants are demanding equal treatment with the citizens of their host countries and , sometimes , their demand takes on dramatic proportions .
the unemployed are demanding equal opportunities as regards the potential for a dignified life and people living in poverty are claiming the same access to health and education as high earners .
humanity is therefore the principle of european enlightenment which is nowadays proving to be the major demand of european societies and the major risk for the leaders of europe .
how can humanity be given meaning ?
some lessons from the long process of european unification already harbour historic truths .
development without social justice is meaningless .
prosperity without wellbeing is simply a contradiction .
the european union is currently going through a period of reflection , as the interval starting after the referenda on the european constitution has been called .
what sort of world are we fighting for ?
what is the vision we are trying to implement ?
is that vision utopian or a realistic ambition ?
we have good reason to be optimistic .
the european union has proven its historic resistance and its attachment to its objectives .
frequently there are delays , other times there are retractions , sometimes there is lassitude , but still the road leads on .
the recent enlargement of the european union , with the accession of ten new member states , caused a real shockwave to resound through europe .
the view prevailed then – and rightly so – that the cost of not enlarging would be greater than the cost of enlargement .
enlargement had an historic and a moral dimension .
the accession of the states of central and eastern europe brought the division of the old continent to an end .
the historic unity of all its peoples was restored in the face of a common destiny .
enlargement was certainly a very important development in the union from the point of view of foreign relations too .
its geopolitical – and hence its strategic size – shifted significantly , giving weight to central europe and making it a direct neighbour of the crucial area of the middle east .
the accession of bulgaria and romania will be especially important , as will the prospects of the completion of union in the western balkans at the next stage , once the conditions have been met .
we welcome this strategic enlargement towards southeast europe .
my country and i personally , as minister of foreign affairs , have played a leading part in its processing and adoption .
