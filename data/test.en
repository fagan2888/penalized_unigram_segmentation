as far as the accession procedure of turkey is concerned , i should like to emphasise that my country is in favour of its integration .
the answer to this disappointment cannot but be to speed up the rate of the political enlargement process .
ladies and gentlemen , the european union was built on the ruins of the second world war .
it was built as a force for peace and stability , prosperity and progress .
at the end of the cold war , the final wall within europe fell , apart from the green line , which continues to divide cyprus in two , defining ...
... a major european problem which still awaits resolution .
a union of 25 member states today , and more tomorrow , cannot exist and prosper except as an independent , strong and unified presence in the international system , with all that this implies .
the war against iraq revealed the split in the european union in a dramatic fashion .
there was not one voice , one decision or one direction ; there was sterile confrontation and clear , dividing lines that injured the peoples of europe .
the cohesive fabric between the member states cannot be just a common currency and a common flag ; it must be a system of principles and values , a common political and social culture .
the challenges are before us .
we hope there will soon be stability in iraq ; the long-suffering iraqi people are in real need of it .
i also consider it important that the european union has decided to continue sending aid to the palestinians , given that depriving them of it will only exacerbate the problems .
this agreement is being sought by european and by all communities , which constantly send messages in favour of peace and dialogue between cultures .
the objectives of this strategy have not been achieved through its implementation .
often , the average citizen feels that he is living in wittgenstein 's nightmare .
the words are used to hide the meaning .
i consider that differences of opinion are the basic privilege of democracy and hence the foundation stone of our union .
life is hard in much of europe today .
despite the fight against unemployment , the minor successes achieved are not enough to combat this major problem .
instead of the numbers of jobs increasing , the unemployment and underemployment indicators are rising in several countries .
instead of the vulnerable groups of the population acquiring greater social protection , there are increasing masses of excluded persons .
instead of the quality of life improving for everyone , the dividing lines of the society of the two-thirds are deepening .
farmers worry about the reform of the common agricultural policy .
young people agonise over jobs ; and then worry about being sacked and having to find another job and , at the end , about their pensions and insurance .
workers worry about their jobs being moved outside europe .
the worst thing is that society has developed a deep distrust of the decision-making centres .
the reason is obvious : there is a serious crisis of confidence between politicians and employment relation theoreticians .
there is acute social insecurity .
unless it invests in the quality of education , research and the challenges of new technologies .
as history has taught us , this can cause dangerous dynamics outside the political system .
human societies have passed through various stages of dominant economic theories .
however , whenever the voice of the people was ignored , tensions and reversals swept away both theories and theoreticians .
the future of europe will be shaped by the citizens of europe and will depend on their participation in public affairs , which is both necessary and desirable in a democracy .
as thucydides says in : ' only those who take no part are regarded not as unambitious but as useless ' , describing with timeless accuracy the importance of active citizens to democracy .
i am sure that they will serve the same purpose as the pole you used to vault with in your youth and will help us to overcome the obstacles facing european integration .
you have referred to many of the problems that we have to resolve and to the role that the european parliament must play in that regard .
you may rest assured , mr president , that this parliament will honour your invitation and will be up to the task of resolving the difficulties facing us , through its democratic strength .
. mr president , i should like to add the following to the existing text of amendment 10 : ‘ while fully respecting the stability and growth pact ’ .
this means that there will be no change of objectives , such as the inclusion of objectives relating to economic growth and employment .
he also offered qualified support for the 1997 version of the stability and growth pact , and has stated that the 2005 reform weakened the pact .
in addition , it should once again be noted that the new faces on the ecb executive board are exclusively from the large countries ( one german replacing another ) .
if one adds the rotation of votes on the council , the small countries are being pushed to the margins when it comes to monetary decisions in the economic and monetary union .
.the illegal copying of designs is one of the causes of counterfeiting .
it constitutes a theft of the intellectual property of businesses , which distorts international trade rules and is responsible for the loss of around 100 000 jobs each year in the eu .
it also constitutes a danger for consumers when counterfeit products may harm their health or compromise their safety .
lastly , it constitutes a source of fiscal and social fraud that places a strain on the member states ’ accounts .
all the resources used to fight against this scourge must therefore be continually strengthened .
design protection – which characterises the creativity and innovation of businesses – is a crucial element of the battery of powers used to combat counterfeiting .
yet , the international registration of these designs is an often complicated and costly process , especially for smes .
all the measures aimed at simplifying these procedures and at making savings will therefore encourage businesses to comply with them and will have a positive effect on research and innovation .
mr rocard ’ s report on accession to the geneva act concerning the international registration of industrial designs is along these lines , and i therefore supported this report .
– we have today voted in favour of mr sousa pinto ’ s report on the interinstitutional agreement .
the report states that the interinstitutional agreement that the european parliament , the council and the commission have managed to reach is compatible with primary european law and the treaties .
it is a positive thing that we have finally reached a settlement on the eu ’ s long-term budget .
at the same time , it is disappointing that no further progress was made in respect of the reform of the budget .
we should have liked to have seen a thorough overhaul of the agreement on agricultural funding and a methodical reform of regional aid .
the reform of the budget must be kept to the fore when the agreed overhaul is due to take place in 2008 / 2009 .
there are also sections of the report that we would rather have done without .
amongst these we might mention what is known as the globalisation fund and the text relating to ‘ own resources ’ .
it is our opinion that it must continue to be the member states that decide what resources the eu has at its disposal .
- a mindset that gradually turns every defeat into a mystifying ‘ victory ’ on the grounds that things could always be worse .
it will then be easier to do away with that percentage that parliament overpays on the lease of its seat in strasbourg , precisely because it appears to be an undue and unwarranted cost .
we must also recognise that the review will include a reduction in workplaces and in the various trips that are sometimes made merely to boost the self-esteem of a specific individual .
although not exciting , the interinstitutional agreement must also be approved , and we approve of the fact that the negotiations have resulted in the political priorities and the financial requirements being combined .
we therefore hope for a great deal of clarity and transparency and for a clear and inflexible approach to separating expenditure and objectives .
.europe is undergoing two kinds of crisis : an institutional one and a political one .
it is imperative that a strong relationship of confidence be built up again between europeans and their institutions .
the first signal that political leaders have a duty to send out to their fellow citizens in order to restore that confidence is one of equipping themselves with a budget that lives up to their much touted ambitions .
moreover , any new policy is out of the question and any recovery unthinkable – this budget symbolises inflexibility and a desire to give in .
that is why i cannot vote in favour of the financial perspective . it overlooks the european interest to the advantage of national self-interests and disappoints our nations with regard to europe ’ s future .
we also warmly welcome the requirement for the national authorities to accept greater accountability for the money they spend .
we would point out ; however , that the compromise deal struck between the parties fails to adequately address the problems that confront the european union today .
in particular it has missed a rare opportunity to alter the political priorities and instead has continued to fund the traditional spending programmes .
we really need to get over this issue of the uk rebate , which has been poisoning european relations for too long .
this additional amount is unjustified , because those extra resources will benefit forms of policy that cannot be regarded as part of the eu ’ s core tasks .
just as i stated earlier , this house pays no more than lip service to the principle of subsidiarity .
i am expressly opposed to resources being set aside for the globalisation fund , the flexibility instrument , the solidarity fund and perhaps also for european schools .
we have today voted in favour of mr böge ’ s report on the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline .
it is important that a settlement has finally been reached on the eu ’ s long-term budget .
we are , however , critical of the support in the report for what is known as the globalisation fund .
globalisation entails great opportunities for the member states of the european union and , insofar as it poses any challenges , these are best dealt with by the member states themselves .
furthermore , we reject the proposal in the report that the eu should have its own resources instead of relying on the contributions of the member states .
it must be for the member states to decide what resources the union has at its disposal .
any form of eu taxation would be a departure from this principle .
.i voted in favour of the böge report because the absence of an agreement on the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013 could undermine the european union ’ s work as from next year .
i should like to take advantage of this opportunity to remind the council of its obligations to ensure that the principles of the 2003 cap reform are respected .
i am completely opposed to the council proposal on voluntary modulation , which transfers 20 % of direct aid to rural development without the obligation of cofinancing .
a system of that kind is unacceptable , given that it could create an imbalance in the market and could constitute a first step towards the renationalisation of the cap .
whilst the budget lacks ambition , we would , without this agreement , be unable to offer the new member states any prospects at all .
moreover , the many programmes would be at risk of grinding to a halt .
a new crisis resulting from rejecting the financial perspectives would represent a huge blow to the european union .
.like the french socialists , i voted against the böge report , which ratifies the interinstitutional agreement on the 2007-2013 financial perspective .
the budget is still not large enough now , and the budgetary wrangling needed to satisfy the justifiable and ever-increasing demands aimed at financing all of the eu policies will be very difficult over the next few years .
. we have today voted in favour of mr böge ’ s report on the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline .
the report approves the budgetary and financial consequences of the agreement which the european parliament , the council and the commission have managed to reach .
it is our opinion that it must continue to be the member states that decide what resources the eu is to have at its disposal .
that was worthwhile .
although i acknowledge that the final outcome of the negotiations , especially regarding the quantitative elements , fell short of the position adopted in june , this has , broadly speaking , been a success .
given the urgent need to obtain an agreement , ‘ this was the only possible compromise ’ .
most of the qualitative elements were reflected in the new interinstitutional agreement .
.i was unable to resign myself to voting in favour of the amended financial perspective .
even though parliament ’ s negotiators succeeded in obtaining an extra eur 2 billion over seven years , the difference between europe ’ s ambition and the sad reality of the budget is striking .
even though the needs identified for the trans-european networks come to eur 18 billion , we allocate eur 7.2 billion .
the needs identified for galileo total eur 2.5 billion , while the appropriations provided for total eur 900 million .
the intelligent part of the cap , rural development , has seen its appropriations halved .
research , the lisbon strategy , social policy - in short , all of the key policies – have been curbed .
europe will not make progress with an annual budget that represents scarcely a third of what the us allocates to its military budget alone .
although this compromise , like every other of its kind , has its weak points , it is nevertheless a step forward and one worth supporting .
it needs to be acknowledged , though , that negotiations of this kind need to be more open and more transparent .
it is not acceptable that certain countries should demand solidarity in one area – agriculture , perhaps – while denying it to others in other areas , such as the structural funds , for example .
it is in everyone ’ s interest that a europe characterised by such ‘ egoisms ’ should steadily be done away with .
- ensure a community budget that , on the basis of national contributions commensurate with the relative wealth of each country ( based on gni ) , will have a redistributive role .
its priorities will be to bring the levels of economic development of the different countries closer together and to improve the living conditions of their workers and citizens .
- an end to the conditionality of the cohesion fund to the stability and growth pact and the non-application of the n + 2 ( or 3 ) rule to this fund or to the structural fund .
- complete compensation for regions that will suffer from the so-called statistical effect , such as the algarve .
- portugal not losing community funding and the creation of a specific programme for modernising the portuguese economy in the context of enlargement .
the community framework that has been adopted runs counter to these objectives and needs .
hence our rejection .
as an mep , it was therefore my responsibility to reject an agreement such as this , which runs counter to the idea i have of a great europe .
i must register my deep concern , however , about the apparent discrepancy between what is stipulated in the agreement reached in december and its practical application .
it would appear that a discrepancy has now emerged in the funds earmarked for the algarve region in the context of exceptional measures adopted for statistical effect regions .
in the name of transparency and good interinstitutional cooperation , i feel that it is extremely important that the bases of the interpretation of the content of the 2007-2013 financial package be clarified .
since it rightly states that parliament is disappointed in the existing financial framework , it is incomprehensible that this so-called compromise should meet with approval .
even though the concluding negotiations produced improvements in quality , the underlying problem has not gone away .
this paltry budget will do nothing to help the eu achieve its high targets in terms of cohesion and development .
it is to 2007 that the new financial perspective will first be applicable .
i wish to point out that i was one of those who , by voting , contributed towards parliament ’ s decision to reject the budgetary agreement reached by the heads of state or government in mid-december 2005 .
this obliged the council of ministers to sit around the negotiating table with parliament with a view to reaching a position that would express the common will of both institutions .
i should like to conclude by pointing out that this agreement falls well short of being completely satisfactory .
it is , however , the agreement that was possible under the current circumstances .
. i welcome the interinstitutional agreement as providing financial stability for the 2007 to 2013 period .
it is an attack on the cap and is effectively a move to renationalise agriculture policy .
the eu has over the last few years undergone a major enlargement process to include new countries and political integration .
this needs to be matched by increased funding .
for the prosperity and security project that the eu represents for its citizens to be a reality , it requires a financial framework to match that ambition and its new size .
in light of these considerations , and in particular the impossibility of going beyond the limited budgetary outcome , my vote in favour is coloured by this regret .
the final stage has been reached on the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013 with the vote in favour of an overall package of eur 866.4 billion .
i should like to quote a figure to you : europe costs each european 26 cents a day .
on the other hand , other areas have been sacrificed , such as ‘ life + ’ , a far-reaching environmental programme that will only receive 16 % of the total funds initially provided for .
to conclude , we have an unsatisfactory agreement and a subsistence budget , which will make it possible to ensure some continuity , but which are nowhere near providing europe with the resources needed for its ambitions .
in spite of this , i voted in favour of the proposal because it would be highly damaging if the european institutions did not have a medium-term financial framework in which to prepare development-related projects .
a further significant reason for voting in favour of the proposal concerns the commitment to review both revenue and spending .
i consider this point to be of major importance , given that i have on a number of occasions expressed the view that the current method of funding the eu has run its course .
for the first time , it has become clear that this reform will take on crucial importance and will require parliament ’ s involvement .
for the period between 2007 and 2013 , parliament has asked eur 112 billion more than the council .
during mr blair ’ s debriefing in december 2005 , the group chairmen of the large groups screamed blue murder , claiming that they would not under any circumstances agree to this result .
five months down the line , it is evident that pressure from the capitals , and particularly from berlin , has worked very well : all the big promises were taken back .
parliament has contented itself with an increase of a mere eur 4 billion .
this agreement will be unable to adequately meet the major challenges that the eu is facing .
the people have their expectations of europe , and it is extremely regrettable that we will be unable to meet them .
following many meetings , the agreement reached by the trialogue has made it possible to secure an extra eur 2 billion , which is far from satisfactory .
solidarity mechanisms are being preserved , although we will not see them increase in importance , as i would have wished .
it is for these reasons that i will vote in favour of this financial perspective , but i will obviously be unenthusiastic about doing so .
parliament has , i believe , done a good job – better than ever before and , above all , better than the two other institutions .
it is thanks to our preparatory work and negotiators that we , despite the commission ’ s half-hearted commitment and governments ’ tight-fistedness , have firm prospects .
in the current circumstances , this agreement is better than the absolute uncertainty surrounding the entire financial policy .
there is one thing that still sticks in my throat , and that is the treatment meted out to rural development , along with the possible moves towards the renationalisation of agricultural policy .
since we have no guarantees , though , of being able to get agricultural policy on the right track without either the constitution or financial perspectives , this was not a good enough reason to reject the whole initiative .
there is no such thing as a perfect budget .
in addition to the quantitative gains in relation to the council ’ s previous proposal , there are also qualitative benefits that portugal will enjoy .
what is more , any postponement of the decision would lead to delays in the use of community funds to resolve people 's problems .
europe ’ s citizens – the portuguese in particular – would not appreciate any further delays .
this money would have been better spent on the political priorities of the member states in respect of expenditure .
we therefore reject the agreement on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 .
the eu budget must depend on membership fees from the member states , and the size of these membership fees must be decided by the council of ministers .
.in june 2005 , parliament estimated that the union required a budget of eur 974 billion in order to face up to the challenges of the future .
this is a minimalist agreement that does not provide the union with sufficient leeway to conduct new policies for the future .
the only thing going for this financial perspective is the fact that it exists .
we can no longer postpone our vote for fear of not being able to start the new programming period in time .
the member states and the regions must , in particular , be able to develop and launch their projects in good time so that the latter can be cofinanced as from 2007 .
it would , in fact , be tragic if the poorest regions in europe were unable to have access to structural aid as from 2007 .
those are the reasons justifying my abstention .
.i am not going to get into a dispute over figures in order to explain to you why i voted against the reports by mr böge and mrs sousa pinto , both of which relate to the financial perspective .
the advocates of this compromise , which they themselves describe as ' tolerable ' , will not hold it against me , i hope , if i harbour a different ambition for europe and its citizens to theirs .
this financial perspective is tragically lacking in ambition for the future of the european project and merely helps to promote intergovernmentalism .
it is regrettable that the european parliament has not heeded the 1 % target of the g6 countries but has instead worked for a budget framework far in excess of this amount .
the agreement also lacks ambition in respect of the necessary reforms of both agricultural policy and regional policy .
within the framework of a long-term budget of 1 % of gni , there must also be room to invest in scientific research and to support enlargement .
i have therefore chosen to reject the financial consequences that would be associated with the interinstitutional agreement and have voted against the reports in their entirety .
the only thing that would promote the transfer of goods to rail would , it appeared , be qualitative and structural improvements .
i believe that the only rational approach to resolving this problem would be a radical reshaping of our transport system , which has , to date , favoured transport criss-crossing the eu from one end to the other .
if , though , this crazy approach to transport is to be maintained , then support should from now on go only to what are termed ‘ roll-on roll-off ’ trains .
let us not forget that the initial budget came to eur 740 million and the amount adopted today only comes to eur 400 million , which means a 46 % reduction .
. europe 's transport system is expected to see an increase of road freight by 2013 of more than 60 % .
the results will be greater congestion and environmental degradation , more accidents and a loss of competitiveness of european industry , which must rely , for the management of its supply chains , on cost-efficient transportation .
in this situation , a greater reliance on intermodality is necessary .
in my own constituency of munster , i have just learned that the port of limerick is to lose substantial facilities through sale of important land .
this will cause an increase of heavy road traffic in the limerick city area .
i see my vote today as a support for not only maintaining existing water-borne freight traffic , but also for moving it from road to water .
i know that there are no marco polo projects in ireland , but i intend to urge the interested parties in munster and ireland to look for projects that are acceptable under marco polo .
that is why the group of the kommounistiko komma elladas in the european parliament did not vote in favour of the report on the proposal for a regulation establishing the second marco polo programme .
we think it important that parliament be able to demonstrate a broad majority in favour of measures to fight and eradicate tses .
our view is that ruminants should not be fed animal protein .
experts in the field believe that this may , however , be justified in one exceptional case , namely fish bone meal as a protein replacement for calves .
our view is that , in such a case , this process must be preceded by careful monitoring in order to ensure that the feedstuff in question is fish bone meal rather than any other animal protein .
the compromise adopted today establishes a series of rules regarding breeding programmes to select for resistance to tses or to export and import animal feed .
– the prevention , combating and elimination of the transmission of spongiform encephalopathy is needed in order to protect public health and livestock .
this is the way to safeguard consumer confidence in the food chain .
outbreaks of bse are declining ; nonetheless , we must aim to put the crisis well and truly behind us by adapting to the new circumstances and taking preventive measures which make use of scientific studies and findings .
today 's report has several positive proposals in this direction .
however , it does not avoid contradictions with certain amendments that leave the way open for the adoption of the use of animal proteins in ruminants , thereby negating the positive points of the report .
this way of thinking disregards and puts public health in third place , setting profits above all .
this is also the main element of the capitalist system , which is why it is barbaric and inhumane .
it is also dangerous for the food chain and the public health of the peoples .
we have every reason to fight to overturn it .
tses are brain disorders in animals and include sub-categories such as bse and other diseases .
the aim is to streamline the risk categories while improving eu animal health controls and maintaining consumer protection .
in the compromise , steps are being taken to relax the ban on feeding non-ruminants animal meal , provided that animals are not fed animal meal originating from their own species .
while the vvd welcomes this development , we are dissatisfied with the fact that in the compromise , nothing is being said about imposing the same requirements on imported products .
indeed , non-ruminant products from third countries need not meet any conditions in terms of feeding animal meal .
the vvd believes that third-country products should meet the same requirements , certainly where food safety is at stake .
despite this , the vvd has voted in favour , because the compromise , in many ways , represents an improvement on the current situation .
approval of the compromise means agreement at first reading , which means that these improvements can actually be carried out in the short term .
i am therefore voting against this part of the proposal , although otherwise this is a good compromise .
i voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague , mrs plestinska , on the proposal for a decision of the european parliament and of the council on the financing of european standardisation .
the text proposed by the european commission and adopted at first reading makes it possible to give a crucial legal basis to the financing of european standardisation .
standardisation is one of the tools needed for applying community policies , especially those concerned with the internal market and with increasing the competitiveness of businesses .
i am delighted that access to this financing has been extended beyond the traditional beneficiaries that are usually referred to as ' european standards organisations ’ and will include more activities .
this is a significant show of support , particularly for those european standards that are in competition with other standards worldwide .
technical measures implementing standardisation are a precondition for the satisfactory functioning of the internal market .
it is thus necessary to grant funding to those institutions that are to develop such common standards .
the financing of the institutions and organisations in question should nonetheless be debated and established within the framework of the regular budget negotiations .
it is irresponsible to lay down at this stage the indicative amounts that the institutions in question are to be granted .
this legislation is based on the fundamental misconception that the aim of standardisation is to increase the competitiveness of businesses rather than to make life easier for consumers .
what is more , it is only logical that industry should pay for standardisation itself if , indeed , it is only businesses that are to benefit .
i therefore oppose the eu granting funding to this work , which should be self-financed through charges .
i am thus voting against the proposal .
it creates a framework for financing standardisation activities for the implementation of community policies .
one more proposal , which , if seen as what it is , introduces a better financing framework and facilitates the adoption of european standards , particularly for very small enterprises and manufacturers .
the commission must be subject to censure , not only for what it does but equally for what it does not do .
obviously , for the commission , the prosperity of citizens and the harmonisation of social models and systems of social protection – upwards not downwards – is not a priority .
this commission continues to ignore the voice of the people calling for harmonisation of social systems before any such internal market is put in place , resulting in social dumping .
instead it presents a new lisbon strategy and a directive on liberalisation of services ( bolkestein ) as the panacea to all our problems .
abstention would be the best choice , as a protest vote against the general policy of the commission and especially the fact that european citizens are at the bottom of its list of priorities .
i voted in favour of the excellent report by my fellow member , mr rosati , on public finances in economic and monetary union .
it was crucial to declare that the public finance situation is very worrying to say the least , with some member states going bankrupt .
the absence of political will to bring some sense back to the crucial budgetary adjustments is reflected in a tragic increase in debt .
how long is this irresponsibility going to last ?
similarly , there is no mention of the elements of poverty and unemployment for the peoples , who are called upon every time to pick up the bill , so that big business can maintain its profitability and exploitation .
the slow rate of the structural reforms ordered by the anti-grass roots lisbon strategy is presented as the cause of the debt and deficit .
these are the results of the capitalist barbarity from the policy of the Εu and the governments .
this policy is inhumane and must be overturned .
the message from the grass-roots fight is the need for grass-roots prosperity .
i especially welcome the reference to the need to channel efforts into increasing the effectiveness of the preventative and corrective political measures for strengthening and consolidating the eu 's public finances .
the fact that the necessary reforms were not carried out reduced growth and jobs and put pressure on public finances .
this question will only be resolved when a question of common interest to the eu is addressed by all member states .
european growth remains worryingly slow .
these measures are crucial for the european economy to grow strongly on sound foundations , in such a way that it can provide fresh business and job opportunities for its citizens .
we cannot , however , overlook the difficulties that some member states have had in recent years in keeping public deficits within the levels of the stability and growth pact .
a further reason for us to follow this issue with concern and to call on the commission and the member states to take structural measures and be prepared for genuine coordination of economic policies .
this year we are doing so .
i hope our proposal for an annual eu list of countries of concern will be considered in that context .
i would like to thank the commissioner , too , for her support for this approach and for listening and responding to parliament by agreeing to a separate legal instrument for human rights .
this will allow us to continue funding human rights projects , despite opposition from governments responsible for oppression and abuse .
it is the right choice .
of course parliament will , this year and every year , offer constructive criticism .
human rights are not a part-time occupation .
when un troops in liberia stand accused of rape and torture , how can europe launch its own esdp mission in aceh , indonesia , without any human rights monitoring ?
why do the eu ’ s human rights consultations allow russia to exclude human rights ngos and why does our human rights dialogue with china not even benefit from simultaneous language interpretation ?
why have nine member states , including germany , ireland , and portugal , failed to sign the un optional protocol against torture ?
eleven eu countries refuse to sign the council of europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings , including britain , france and spain .
why have seven of our members considered signing so-called immunity agreements in opposition to the jurisdiction of the international criminal court ?
we must use a more sophisticated sliding scale of sanctions and make it easier to find political agreement in the eu to apply them .
we should ensure that one staff member in every commission delegation , in 118 countries worldwide , is responsible for reporting and promoting human rights obligations .
we must make the un and its international human rights conventions a contractual obligation of the stabilisation , association and accession process , starting with ourselves .
it is time to say that the threats might change , but that human rights are inviolable .
europe must practice what it preaches .
. mr president , let me begin on a personal note : this is my third opportunity to speak in this house about the broad issues of human rights .
as far as the austrian presidency is concerned , this issue is very dear to our hearts and we want to deal with it in a way that corresponds to what the rapporteur has just said .
we want the european union as a whole to be perceived by our partners and by the outside world as speaking with one voice and conveying the values of the european union .
i should like to begin by thanking the european parliament for its cooperation and we should also like to thank the commissioner and the commission for their contributions .
we are grateful this year that , for the first time , parliament has adopted a comprehensive approach .
it has not just listed one human rights violation after another in a given country but has adopted a comprehensive approach and policy , which the council very much appreciates .
to those – be they women or men – who are threatened and tortured for standing up for human rights , it is irrelevant whether the european union now speaks through parliament , the council or the commission .
the important thing is that we in the european union should speak at all .
people who rely on help from the european union do so irrespective of the institution , and that is why cooperation between the institutions is so very important .
i would like , at this point , to make reference to something that is very important to me personally , even though it may well not be directly connected with the report .
the austrian presidency is endeavouring , if at all possible , to set up the fundamental rights agency , and to bring about a final agreement on it , before our presidency comes to an end .
we had , this morning , a highly constructive sitting with parliament and the commission , in the course of which we agreed on the basis outlines of what this fundamental rights agency is going to be like .
the presidency will be working very hard to that end .
we have closely examined the report , and we are appreciative of the efforts of the rapporteur and of all the members of your house who worked on it .
i would just like to give particular attention to a few points .
passing on to the subject of the anti-torture guidelines , we repeatedly hear it said that the european union does not do enough in individual cases .
the subject of torture and inhumane treatment is of course an important one , and it is one that we keep on raising in our human rights dialogues with third countries .
the human rights council will meet for the first time on 19 june , in other words , before the end of our presidency .
our desire is that this new united nation body should , in future , make a constructive and essential contribution to working for human rights around the world .
in conclusion , i would like once more to emphasise the great importance of exchange between the institutions in terms of our work for human rights .
only an even-handed and universal human rights policy on the part of the european union will get a hearing and , eventually , bear fruit .
our common goal is an effective and visible human rights policy for the european union , which will see us standing up for our values .
the european parliament is making a significant contribution in this respect , to which tribute was paid in the european union ’ s annual report for 2005 .
the european parliament ’ s achievements should and will receive due recognition in the forthcoming annual report , which will be prepared under the finnish presidency .
i would like , once again to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for this outstanding report .
as the president said , both the commission and the council have to work very closely together in order to have a comprehensive human rights policy .
let me make a few comments and raise a few issues .
first , i acknowledge the strong support of parliament for the european initiative for democracy and human rights , and its continued interest .
i share the concern to make our actions in the area more flexible and in tune with the needs of the grassroots organisations .
this year we are already trying out concrete improvements in our procedures , notably in the calls for proposals .
we also need to better adapt the programme to the sensitive situations and restrictions often faced by civil society organisations .
i will certainly continue to rely on your support to carry through those changes .
that is clearly reflected in the significant increase in the number of observation missions over the last two years , particularly in post-conflict and transition situations .
the professional and independent approach of eu electoral observers is highly regarded and enjoys credibility and leverage .
i am sensitive to the need to ensure that any further increase in that area does not squeeze resources from other priorities and i can assure you that i will do my best in that regard .
thirdly , i welcome your positive comments on the human rights work of the eu in multilateral fora .
great efforts go into consolidating eu positions in such fora , which are often instrumental in achieving progress .
as the president has already said , that leadership role of the european union was clearly visible in the negotiations establishing the human rights council .
i should like to pay tribute to the austrian presidency , which capably steered through somewhat difficult waters .
now that elections to the council have taken place , the real work of this new body at the helm of the international and human rights system begins .
i am confident that it will prove more efficient than the old commission on human rights .
fourthly , i should like to pay tribute to the work leading to the report on gender equality and women ’ s rights .
i welcome the recommendations made by the rapporteur on the format of this and future reports .
i hope that it will be possible to make the 2006 eu human rights report a truly interinstitutional report .
that should not in any way be interpreted as impinging on the prerogatives of parliament to scrutinise the work of the council and commission .
but there will be space and need for a separate report by parliament on the european union ’ s human rights policy .
in that task , cooperation between parliament , the council and the commission is crucial .
you can be sure that we are a partner in it .
. mr president , firstly , i welcome the change in the scheduling of debates to allow the human rights report to be debated this afternoon in the primetime slot .
i want to thank the chairmen of the various groups for that . it is recognition of the importance of this report .
this year , we have a very different report , in style and in content .
we are essentially undertaking an experiment .
we are doing this on the understanding that the council will work closely with us to produce a common and unified human rights report for the eu .
that report will provide the general assessment of human rights across the globe and of many of the broader questions and challenges , as well as the more local challenges .
in the past , as you know , parliament and the council have both essentially duplicated each other ’ s work to a certain extent by producing similar reports .
certainly , as rapporteur last year , i saw a huge amount of duplication between the report produced by parliament and the one the council produced .
however , if the council does not significantly consult and include parliament when putting its report together in the coming year , we will have to revert to our previous approach .
parliament can then focus on the job that it was elected to do : assessing the performance of the council and the commission on behalf of the people .
finally , i want to congratulate mr howitt on doing an excellent job this year under new and different circumstances .
the fact that we only have 14 amendments to the report tomorrow is a reflection on the work he has done .
i can assure him that he is unlikely to get the kind of shock that other rapporteurs have received the night before or on the day of the vote on the human rights report .
there can be no european political project without making human rights a priority .
lowering our guard in terms of human rights – and that may be what we are doing – means surrendering democratic standards and the european union ’ s greatest values .
we cannot permit this kind of double standard for the sake of . such double standards are unsustainable since they greatly harm the credibility of our democracy .
people suffering from persecution , torture , discrimination fear and death expect us to take decisive and coherent action to defend their rights .
. mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this human rights report is clear , comprehensive and ambitious .
it is an appeal in favour of more coordination and more coherence in the human rights policy of the eu and of the member states .
i endorse the rapporteur ’ s point of view that the european initiative for democracy and human rights is an extremely important instrument in the eu ’ s human rights strategy .
i also share commissioner ferrero-waldner ’ s view that more funds need to be set aside for election observation missions , which , certainly in post-conflict situations , are crucial in strengthening democracy and human rights .
i also have high expectations of the inclusion of human rights clauses in all eu agreements .
a policy of double standards threatens to make the eu ’ s human rights policy less credible and should be avoided at all costs .
what is so good about the howitt report is that , in moving away from situation ethics , it finally offers a prospect of a more systematic and integrated approach .
that is something i can support with a great deal of enthusiasm .
. mr president , the subcommittee decided this year to change the structure of the annual report on human rights .
we achieved this result despite the difficulties involved .
we can congratulate the rapporteur and the political groups .
parliament ’ s role consists in guiding , monitoring and assessing the policy of the council and of the commission .
that is why it is crucial that parliament continues to draft its own report .
the amendment to article 8 that we have tabled is along these lines .
mr howitt ’ s report presents a number of interesting and innovative proposals concerning the mechanisms for promoting human rights .
the report specifically calls for qualified majority voting within the council and for possible restrictive measures against a third country .
it logically follows on from the report adopted by parliament : the agnoletto report .
the report also proposes to ensure that the united nations commission for human rights , which has recently been set up , is not chaired by a state that is responsible for human rights violations .
furthermore , it proposes to implement a system aimed at keeping meps regularly informed of the actions carried out by the council and the commission .
the report also stresses the need for cross-cutting human rights policies to be drafted within parliament .
it is in this spirit that the subcommittee proposed to allow the delegations to put forward candidates for the sakharov prize .
as such , i reject paragraph 97 , which in some ways supports the implementation of the pilot regional protection programmes .
these programmes do not seem appropriate to me .
the document in question also specifically condemns the bilateral agreements that a number of eu countries have drawn up with the united states for the purposes of guaranteeing impunity to us soldiers .
– mr president , i wonder what human rights we are talking about , when our economic policy creates an eminently class-ridden society .
if we really want to consider human rights , we will not do so in this house ; let us go to the rest rooms so you can see the women working there .
no relation of ours is working there ; poor , respectable women from north africa are working there .
so who is talking about human rights ?
those who exterminated , who eliminated an entire race from the face of the earth ?
the red indians .
who is talking about human rights ?
those who based their wealth on the natives in their colonies for centuries on end ?
those who , with a beer in the evening , enjoy the charms of some beautiful , poor , weak girl from the former eastern bloc ?
who is talking ?
those who accept turkey in europe , when a month ago they murdered a catholic priest there , burned the effigy of the ecumenical patriarch of the orthodox christians and set light to the synagogues ?
i therefore am not prepared to talk about human rights .
my conscience forbids me with everything it sees happening around it , with everything that we all allow to happen .
for a successful human rights policy it is essential for the eu member states to implement a joint , consistent and visible policy in bilateral relations with countries that do not respect human rights .
our relations with russia , as a strategic partner , are very important .
it is therefore essential that in the report the commission and the council are requested to discuss violations of human rights in chechnya during talks with russia .
in the report , hopes are expressed concerning the newly-created un human rights council .
the election of cuba , nigeria and other similar countries , however , prompts concerns regarding the election mechanism and whether the council ’ s work will be more successful than that of the commission on human rights .
the european union must therefore systematically object to the allocation of the presidency to such countries and the council must express the common eu stance .
the commission must therefore demonstrate that no grey areas exist in that regard .
to conclude , i believe that a progressive scale of measures and sanctions to be applied in the event of a human rights violation should be defined as a matter of priority .
human rights policy cannot apply double standards – one approach for small countries and a different one for large countries that are of strategic importance to the european union .
the policy should be effective .
in view of this , the european initiative for democracy and human rights takes on particular importance , as does increasing the budget of this institution .
the european parliament must take on the responsibility for raising the importance of human rights protection in the european union .
it must become a place where new initiatives in this field will emerge , and the institution which coordinates the human rights actions of the different union institutions .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for all his hard work on this report .
i am pleased that we have moved away from just a list of countries where human rights abuses are a problem and i welcome the new measures we are taking in this report .
i hope we continue in this way .
having said that , i am pleased that the situation in kashmir has been included .
i hope we will eventually find a just solution involving the kashmiri people that will end human rights abuses from all sides .
i am also glad that we call in this report for the americans to close down guantanamo bay .
i think it is very important that we do this and that detainees have a fair trial .
again , that is included in this report .
i am sorry , however , that my amendment on cia flights was not accepted by the committee , but i note amendment 5 , which seeks to rectify this situation .
it is very important that we include cia flights in this report .
i would have liked a stronger statement on people with mental health problems , as the rapporteur knows , but i am pleased that they have been included .
i am equally pleased that disabled people have been included generally , with a particular emphasis on the united nations convention on the rights of people with disabilities .
as many of you know , i was parliament ’ s rapporteur on that issue .
i am glad that there is a strong mention of trafficking in human beings .
i , along with mr coveney and various other members , have been campaigning on this subject for quite some time .
i am sorry , however , that we are told repeatedly in our committee that we cannot mention human rights abuses within the european union .
that , i believe , takes away from the strength of our argument when we are talking about human rights abuses in other parts of the world .
among this house ’ s essential functions are the global prosecution of violations of human rights and the promotion and defence of those rights .
what i would like to see in future would be closer attention given to the human rights situation in the countries that are applying for accession to the eu .
mr president , another year , another report , but what real change ?
still we trumpet human rights and democracy clauses in partnership agreements with third countries , but non-compliance largely seems to go unmarked .
apart from a single suspension in the case of relatively insignificant uzbekistan , these clauses might as well not exist , especially with regard to major economic forces like china .
there it seems to some of us that the value of trade persuades the eu to do less than it could about flagrant breaches of human rights and instances of religious persecution .
indeed , one is tempted to say that such is the eu ’ s apparent awe of china that it avoided an opportunity during the year to sponsor a critical motion in the united nations .
likewise , when it came to an opportunity there to join in condemning zimbabwe for its mass forced evictions , the eu countries also avoided that issue .
it is true that we talk the talk of human rights , but too often , it seems to me , we hold back when there are economic interests which we seem to hold dearer .
today we are discussing a truly important report on the human rights situation in the world in 2005 and european union policy in regard to this matter .
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr howitt , for his cooperation .
the bad news is however , that europe is much better at making declarations than it is at adhering to them .
the union is able to take up some sterling work on human rights , but in some strange way is unable to integrate decisions on human rights into its policies and programmes .
if we sincerely cherish our values and want to defend them , this situation must change .
i believe it is high time to identify the countries raising the greatest concern in each annual report , and thus develop an initiative facilitating the establishment of priorities .
such information could be used to draw up the lists of countries causing particular concern with the aim of drawing special attention to them .
it is also clear that significant improvements are needed in respect of the visibility and dissemination of the reports , especially amongst journalists and the national parliaments .
to conclude , i would like to draw your attention , mr president , to a provision in the report which i feel is very important .
and this must be included in our resolution .
i am truly satisfied with mr howitt 's report which i believe is exceptional in the way it does not distinguish between large and small states and treat them under equal standards .
however , in my opinion the paragraph on china lacks some highlighting of the tibet problems .
tibet , as we know , was occupied by china , but for some reason we have recognised it as an inseparable part of china .
china is committing genocide against the tibetan people , but nowhere have we even mentioned that .
the fact alone that each year around 3 000 children , and i stress children , escape to india via the himalayas and nepal just so that they can learn their own language , is worthy of notice .
the tibetan nation and its culture are being extinguished right in front of our eyes .
i believe that we must change our position in respect of tibet , if we really do not want to see the tibetan people and their culture destroyed .
mr president , we find ourselves once again debating the situation of human rights in the world .
i thank the rapporteur for his evident hard work in compiling this comprehensive report , for the cooperative attitude he has demonstrated throughout and his support for the inclusion of kashmir .
for this , i personally thank him .
you take a taxi journey to visit your friends and family that ends in tragedy .
there are no witnesses , for the taxi driver ends up dead and you go straight to the first policeman you can find .
you say he pulled a gun on you and what you did was in self-defence .
today , we reaffirm this house ’ s role as a defender of human rights with a long history of opposition to the death penalty .
i implore you all to live up to the responsibility this position carries and make representations to the president of pakistan , appealing for clemency for mirza tahir hussain .
mr president , during the recent uk presidency , the european union intervened diplomatically in 26 separate matters related to human rights , and published 49 statements on the issue .
it is laudable that we are spending so much time here at the european parliament on issues related to human rights in the broadest sense .
during each strasbourg session we hold debates on infringements of human rights , democratic principles and the rule of law .
however , while we debate the situation in african or asian countries , we cannot forget about the member states .
such problems affect a large number of them , and especially some of the new member states .
let us therefore protect and fight for human rights throughout the world , but let us keep our eyes and ears open and remember that just next door , in a neighbouring state , they are not always respected .
i say this with the utmost conviction as a practising lawyer who sees clear evidence of this happening .
parliament is today calling for all european political institutions to play their part in this master plan of spreading the sacred principles of humanity and the rule of law around the world .
europe cannot be an end in itself .
the union presidencies have a great responsibility to ensure that the human rights policies of the union and its member states are consistent across the board .
a strong , concerted european rights policy would address the litany of horrors that , unfortunately , is not exclusive to underdeveloped countries .
the death penalty , and even the exploitation of work that leads to company relocations , to give two very different examples , can only be combated with a tough concerted rights policy .
– it is clear that europe is becoming more visible and more active when it comes to addressing the issue of human rights .
however , the amount of human rights breaches taking place around us which are being addressed , and whether europe is showing its teeth , is debatable .
it is also very clear that many of the different institutions are giving the impression that they are acting alone .
i am not referring to the council , the commission and parliament , but , for example , to the banking institution .
i think that europe should use the power that it has .
i am aware that this is difficult .
nevertheless , i would like to conclude by referring to paragraph 14 of number 90 , which states : ' welcomes the choice of freedom of expression as a major human rights theme ' .
i would like to mention this because in my country , malta , two journalists , daphne caruana galizia and saviour balzan , have just been the victims of arson attacks .
i would like to express my solidarity with maltese journalists against these attacks , which are a direct attack on their fundamental human rights .
mr president , emphasis on the importance of human rights has been a special feature of pan-european organisations during the entire period since the second world war .
the importance of human rights has not waned as the years have gone by ; on the contrary , it has grown .
human rights are not subordinate to terrorism or active commerce .
the eu can have a huge influence on human rights if it speaks with one voice .
the eu has not always managed to do that , although of course it has sometimes .
at present one would hope that the eu could concentrate more than it does now on eradicating hunger and poverty .
hunger and real poverty are among the worst violations of human rights right now in the world .
i wish to thank the rapporteur , mr howitt , for the excellent cooperation that he has shown , and for taking into consideration the many amendments we have tabled .
furthermore , i was delighted to see that the rapporteur expressly emphasised the importance of the fact that the report resulted from cooperation between parliament , the council and the commission .
only in this way will ngos representing different political groups and their views come to the fore .
mr president , in my speech i would like to point out three issues related to the howitt report .
first of all , the european union should have an effective financial instrument along the lines of the american foundations that support those who fight for human rights across the world .
the organisations and societies which often work illegally and which build and defend democracy , freedom of speech and respect for basic rights deserve our support .
the second issue is the deplorable fact that the european union refused to support the resolution on chechnya at the 61st session of the un commission on human rights .
atrocities are carried out by the russian army in chechnya and between 3 000 and 5 000 chechens have disappeared without trace .
these were unarmed civilians who were detained by the russians .
the third issue i wanted to mention is the critical situation of christians living in muslim countries .
this situation has deteriorated in the last few months .
the war in iraq and the outrage sparked by the publication of the caricatures in european newspapers have created a state of constant danger for christian minorities in the muslim world .
mr president , we must regard the process of globalisation as an opportunity for freedom and social progress .
globalisation is associated with a higher demand for fundamental human freedoms , but only if the opportunities it provides are utilised appropriately .
i have been thinking about the thoughts expressed by the president of the republic of greece today .
europe is the strongest bastion of humanism .
it is important that we can continue to say the same in the future , to make this clear to the rest of the world , and to make it into an example to be followed .
the european union is an international player with a crucial mission to protect human rights , strengthen democracy and ensure that globalisation actually means the achievement of social cohesion .
i believe that it is important for the european union to insist on the enforcement of fundamental human rights in its relations with third countries .
it must employ pragmatically the opportunities for political dialogue provided by foreign trade .
the report can serve as a firm foundation to ensure that in the future we will not just accept statements regarding human rights , but we will also excel in complying with them and in ensuring their enforcement .
my thanks to the rapporteur .
in a field such as the promotion and protection of human rights , the assessment is inevitably mixed .
i should like to tell you how i see the situation .
first , is the eu an important player in this field , which counts and is counted on ?
my response to that , without doubt , is yes .
we have continually seen this demonstrated .
secondly , does the eu have the right tools to perform its activities ?
my response to that too is yes .
we have access to international instruments as part of the united nations and the council of europe , to name but two .
we have the framework of our widely quoted bilateral agreements , including human rights clauses , and common political guidelines in many sectors , political dialogues and approaches of all kinds .
we also have the financial , geographical and thematic instruments .
thirdly , are we contributing and doing enough ?
to that , i would tend to say no , particularly if our actions are examined in general terms .
finally , is the human rights policy we are pursuing effective ?
are we having an impact ?
for my part , i , like parliament , should like us to increase our effectiveness and impact .
and we need , in some cases , to create a better balance between our multilateral agenda and the bilateral agenda .
we also need to mobilise all the institutions of the union , including , of course , the european parliament .
as i have already said , we are very much in favour of a report drawn up jointly by the three institutions .
let us work towards this !
parliament can certainly count on me .
neither i nor my services will spare any efforts .
you can count on us for the assessment and also the implementation of the human rights policy , even if we too are often faced with a political reality that is not easy to control .
that is why we need to give constant thought to how we could improve our performance , and what this debate has done is to help us to do just that .
a range of issues have been addressed , and i would just like to touch very briefly on one or two of them .
it was said , and quite rightly too , how important civil society is in terms of human rights .
institutions of state and governments are particularly dependent on the cooperation of civil society and non-governmental organisations .
human rights and good governance have an increasing role to play in development cooperation .
mr coveney said that the council and parliament should not duplicate each other ’ s work .
however , at the same time , we must cooperate where necessary in order to be more efficient .
to that , i would like to say that i regard the human rights clauses as very important , in that they do not only provide for sanctions or for the suspension of treaties .
this is where a certain realism is called for , without losing a firm hold on the relevant principles .
i do believe that the chances of the human rights council becoming an effective instrument will turn out to be unaffected .
mr salafranca sánchez-neyra and others stressed the european union ’ s role in the world at large , not least in connection with the accession negotiations and the relationship with the balkan states .
mrs lynne talked about trafficking in human beings .
i fully agree that this issue is very important .
i should just like to mention that the european union cooperates closely in this respect with the osce , which is very active in this field .
we should continue this cooperation and , again , there should be no duplication but rather a synergy effect .
mrs lynne and others talked about the question of human rights in the european union .
of course there are human rights violations in all european union countries , including my own .
however , what makes the european union different from other regions in the world is that we have effective instruments to deal with human rights violations .
all european union member states are also members of the council of europe and signatories to the convention on human rights .
there is the unique instrument of the human rights court in strasbourg , and within the european union we also have the necessary mechanisms and instruments to take care of any violations .
we should not confuse the situation within the european union with that in other states where such instruments do not exist .
i fully agree with mrs esteves and others that there should be no double standards and that the credibility of the european union is the most important thing .
that is why i reject all allegations that we distinguish between small and large countries .
i do not think we treat one country differently from another , which is important .
so , assuming i have understood the report correctly , i thank you all very much for the support the council ’ s policy has received .
let us continue to defend human rights everywhere in the world and let us do so together .
the eu is the world 's standard-bearer where the protection of human rights is concerned .
much still remains to be done , however , if we are to turn our intentions into practical actions aimed at creating effective strategies to improve the international human rights situation .
consistency is also duly required between the community ’ s actions and those carried out by each individual member state .
i would like to congratulate mr howitt on his report .
our twin reports in parliament on human rights in the world and human rights in the union demonstrate the importance we place on this issue .
our consistent campaign against the death penalty , whether in the united states or china , iran or japan , is to be welcomed .
my own government in britain was influential in pushing this forward during its presidency last year .
my only criticism on this foreign affairs committee report would be its unevenness in places and its over-reliance on third-hand reports .
for example , saudi arabia barely gets a mention .
the situation is that the majority of the population – its women – face vicious discrimination .
followers of all faiths , save its own peculiar form of islam , face persecution and where torture and mutilation are rife .
equally , it reports persecution of journalists in north korea .
yet as someone who follows the country closely , it is a complaint i have never heard .
when we talk about the european community and common european values , the first issue we must mention is the protection of human rights .
the european constitution will represent a further , considerable step forward , by giving constitutional status to the charter of fundamental rights , and by creating an independent european human rights protection system .
the report , too , shows that the current situation is mixed and contradictory .
i believe it is important that during the negotiation of both stabilisation and association agreements , human rights are given primary emphasis , in the spirit of copenhagen .
i welcome this report by my colleague richard howitt on human rights in the world 2005 .
he is right to draw to our attention to the fact that while the eu is vigorous in promoting human rights , its efforts are largely confined to specialist and one-off representations .
we need a common , consistent and transparent policy for dealing with abuses of human rights in third countries .
it is over a year and a half since the commission tabled its proposals .
i wish to acknowledge the efforts that have been made by parliament and successive council presidencies to find imaginative and constructive solutions to the challenges that we have encountered on these innovative proposals .
the new simplified architecture was the first attempt to streamline all the instruments for external spending .
the simplification proposed was welcomed by both parliament and the council .
and soon after parliament began its work , a certain number of important questions were raised .
there were six issues in total and on these i believe parliament has obtained full satisfaction .
your first concern was to ensure that the instruments were adopted under codecision whenever the treaty made that possible .
in response , the council and the commission agreed that the stability instrument should pass from consultation of parliament to codecision .
three of the four instruments are codecided .
this gives parliament a fully legitimate but unprecedented degree of legislative power over the framework covering external spending .
parliament also wished to ensure that the instruments would be subject to a mid-term review and to expiry dates .
these points were accepted .
should the review identify problems that require an adaptation of the relevant instruments and regulations , the commission will submit the necessary legislative proposals .
that review should be carried out in 2009 , as requested by parliament .
parliament also wanted separate financial envelopes for different geographic regions and thematic sectors .
the commission has provided a breakdown of the envelopes for the codecided instruments and agrees to the inclusion of a breakdown in the regulations .
one of the most challenging points has been the involvement of parliament in priority-setting and strategy documents .
so far as priority-setting is concerned , the necessary policy elements will be included in the draft regulations .
this has been done both for the stability instrument and for the european neighbourhood and partnership instrument .
unfortunately , the progress achieved on these instruments has not yet been mirrored in the development cooperation and economic cooperation instrument .
parliament ’ s future involvement in strategy documents is now covered by two declarations annexed to the interinstitutional agreement .
i have written to mr brok on how these could be put into practice .
finally , for the development cooperation and economic cooperation instrument , parliament wished to have a clear distinction between policy towards developing countries and towards industrialised countries .
we have no difficulty in accepting that .
there has been a strong demand from parliament for a separate instrument to support democracy and human rights .
in january 2006 , the commission set out its vision for the thematic programme on democracy and human rights .
i recognise that parliament is not convinced on this .
i have listened to parliament and i understand its reasons .
i am committed , therefore , to resolving this point to the satisfaction of parliament as part of an overall agreement on the instruments .
this is a clear commitment on behalf of the commission to a separate human rights instrument .
this position is shared by the council .
i should now like to say a few words on each of the instruments that are before this house today .
the instrument for pre-accession assistance – the ipa – has been welcomed by parliament for its policy-driven approach .
there has been a fruitful dialogue on the proposed regulation with parliament ’ s rapporteur , mr szent-iványi .
indeed , a compromise text for ipa , addressing a number of issues of concern to parliament , was agreed by coreper on 3 may .
the commission fully supports this compromise , which reflects to a large extent the amendments proposed by mr szent-iványi in his report .
i am pleased to make a formal declaration today , which i hope will also solve the major outstanding issue of parliament ’ s involvement in the suspension of assistance :
the report from the committee on foreign affairs has had a very positive impact on the political compromise reached in coreper , for which i thank you .
that compromise is very finely balanced .
i believe it will form the basis of a deal between the institutions .
reflecting concerns of parliament , we have also agreed more policy content under the stability instrument .
there are strengthened references to respect for human rights in relation to the fight against terrorism .
the commission is ready to make a political declaration further underlining this and confirming its commitment to informing parliament of exceptional assistance measures as they are adopted .
i shall be writing to you shortly setting out some ideas on the establishment of a peace-building partnership to improve practical implementation of civilian peace-building projects .
for the european neighbourhood and partnership instrument , we have worked intensively with mr szymánski , parliament ’ s rapporteur , and the presidency .
as a result , we now have a text which addresses the concerns of parliament .
an agreement on this text was reached in coreper last week and we are very hopeful that , on this basis , an agreement is now within reach .
for the development cooperation and economic cooperation instrument , work is not as advanced as for the other instruments .
i am convinced that the main building blocks of a compromise are , however , within reach .
thanks to the cogent arguments of the rapporteur , mr mitchell , it is agreed that the new legislative set-up must preserve parliament ’ s codecision rights .
it is now a question of the best way to do it .
the commission is calling for pragmatism , given our shared objective of achieving genuine simplification of external assistance .
in more concrete terms , let me come to the main amendments proposed in mr mitchell ’ s report .
given their total number , i will concentrate on those that relate to the architecture of the instrument .
this alternative to the incorporation of policy content and financial provisions into the regulation goes against the objective of simplification .
the commission is more than willing to expand the geographic and thematic policy content of the dceci to preserve parliament ’ s rights .
we have said so on several occasions .
however , we consider that the best way to achieve this is to follow the council presidency ’ s proposal and to do it in a single regulation .
they actually go further and propose the splitting of cooperation with industrialised countries from the dceci .
the commission understands the underlying concern behind these amendments .
i know legal advice differs on this .
for the commission , the issue is one of legal security .
the commission also understands parliament ’ s argument that a wide understanding of development cooperation should offer the necessary comfort .
i would be ready to re-consider our position if a wide definition of development cooperation based on article 179 is ensured .
fifth , one amendment – amendment 51 on sectoral spending targets – is of particular concern .
this is the establishment of sectoral spending targets .
this would run contrary to the principles of partnership and ownership with beneficiary countries and it would introduce rigidity in programme implementation .
there are also a number of other amendments that would need to be discussed in more depth .
a document has been submitted to parliament setting out the commission ’ s position on each of the amendments ( 1 ) .
i do not want to give the impression that our positions are far apart on all these issues .
out of 117 amendments , the commission can accept 26 in full and 40 in part or in principle .
this means that half of the amendments are totally uncontroversial .
finally , i should like to say a few words on nuclear safety .
this has been an important part of our past work and will remain so .
originally included within the stability instrument , the change in the legal basis made it necessary to create a separate instrument for nuclear safety cooperation .
i understand that the draft text has now been sent by the council to parliament to allow you to begin preparing your opinion .
i should like to finish by saying a few words on the way forward .
there are grounds for optimism that agreement could be found on the text of two of the codecided instruments : the stability instrument and the european neighbourhood and partnership instrument .
similarly , i hope that the declaration i made concerning the pre-accession instrument is sufficient to allow parliament to give its opinion .
what now of the development cooperation and economic cooperation instrument ?
this is a key element in the architecture .
this instrument covers assistance to asia , latin america and south africa , as well as key thematic programmes .
it is central to the package and too important to be left behind .
i am convinced that we can do what needs to be done to ensure that the complete legislative framework is in place before the end of the year .
the presidency has already done considerable work on the policy content of the dceci .
there will be a window of opportunity following parliament ’ s first reading to reach a consensus on the key issues of substance before the adoption of the council ’ s common position .
this could cover some limited changes in the architecture , which would not undermine the principle of simplification and the essential policy provisions .
the consensus reached would be reflected in the council ’ s common position , which the council presidency hopes to adopt in june .
this would greatly facilitate a timely agreement on second reading .
finally , the provision of effective assistance to our partners from 1 june 2007 onwards is a shared responsibility .
with the agreement on the financial perspective and the advances made on this legislative package , i am convinced we are within striking distance of achieving that goal .
you have , by a very clear majority , adopted an important compromise , and i believe that commissioner ferrero-waldner ’ s speech just now gives us reason to take a fundamentally optimistic view of things .
i hope , in my capacity as a representative of the council , to be able to contribute to the generally optimistic mood .
much of what the commissioner has said reflects the council ’ s way of thinking .
here , too , we are singing from the same hymn sheet and hoping that we will succeed in very soon putting the finishing touches to the instruments we are discussing today .
given the complexity of the subject matter , this could certainly not have been taken for granted , and it amounts in itself to a gigantic leap forward .
i would now like to say something in brief about each of the instruments in turn .
we are glad to be able to say that , where the neighbourhood instrument is concerned , we have largely achieved agreement , and i would like to thank mr szymański for his very constructive cooperation in this respect .
i would remind you of the debate that we had on this subject earlier on .
we have also come to a firm agreement on the importance we attach to the role of civil society and our desire to support and promote it .
as for cross-border cooperation , we have not only laid down the partnership principle but have gone further and stressed – as your house demanded – that the regions have to be involved .
we have , though , made a good deal of progress , and the council has endeavoured to meet your house halfway on a number of issues in this respect .
we have accommodated parliament ’ s desire that it should not merely be consulted but also enjoy the power of codecision .
we have managed , albeit as a result of difficult negotiations , to accede to parliament ’ s request for a broad scope .
the commission has already made reference to this .
all these things are requirements on which we have insisted , or which we have supported , in the previous debate on the coherence of european human rights policy .
i am sure that i can say , on behalf of the council , that this made it possible for us to come up with a good result .
i have to thank mr szent-iványi now that i come to speak to the pre-accession instrument , which is , by its very nature , particularly important .
we have , for example , laid greater emphasis on the gender aspect and on social cohesion and made programmes for potential candidates more widely accessible .
we have also agreed to parliament ’ s demand that it should be consulted on strategic issues such as the suspension of ipa funds .
our common objective is that the european union should be capable of acting in every sphere of foreign policy , and it is regrettable that this – despite some encouraging progress – has not been achieved .
what matters now is that we do something of some practical usefulness in moving the process forward as swiftly as possible and adopting the draft acts and regulations in short order .
that must now be the common goal of the council , parliament and the commission , and it is one that we must take seriously .
i would like to take this opportunity to once more explain in detail why this process needs to be completed , and these draft regulations adopted , as soon as possible .
the existing regulations on the neighbourhood and stability instruments are due to lapse at the end of this year .
a substantial implementing regulation for the pre-accession instrument still needs to be worked out and adopted if the financial resources – in respect of which negotiations were so long drawn-out and laborious – are to be put to work .
it is for that reason that your house needs to vote on this by june at the latest .
we do not want a financial black hole here .
i therefore want to appeal to you all on behalf of the council not to jeopardise the timely adoption of the instruments .
here , the council has shown itself willing to take your house ’ s main concerns on board , and i hope that this is a matter of common knowledge .
as you can see , the council is prepared to meet your house more than halfway on the things that matter to you .
the only thing i have to say – and i have to spell this out – is that the development cooperation and economic cooperation instrument must not be broken down any further .
to reduce it to still more component parts would quite simply make an absurdity of our aim of simplifying the overall structure of the european union ’ s overseas aid .
to do so would be the very opposite of what we are endeavouring to do under the heading of ‘ better regulation ’ .
the commissioner has already said the same thing , and i – speaking on behalf of the council – would like to back her up in the strongest terms .
we do not doubt that the european parliament attaches every bit as much importance as does the council to this deficit being made good as soon as possible .
the poorest countries on this planet of ours would find it beyond their comprehension if they were , so to speak , to be presented with the bill for a controversy between one institution and another .
i would therefore hope that we will succeed in finding a solution that would prevent us from ending up in a legal vacuum after 1 january 2007 .
that much is essential , and it is something on which both the commission and the council agree completely .
what is needed , then , is a package solution , and , in order to obtain one , we are relying on your house ’ s goodwill and willingness to compromise .
. mr president , before going into the substance i would like to welcome the presence of the commission and the council .
i particularly appreciate the efforts of successive presidencies to find a solution to the outstanding problems linked to the original commission proposal on the dceci .
when debating this instrument , our overriding concern must be the interests of the developing countries , and in particular the poorest sections of their populations .
the remit of the committee on development is to represent their interests at european union level and to ensure that they are kept on the eu ’ s political agenda .
i believe that this view is now widely accepted and i hope that the commission now accepts it also .
those three levels are complementary and parliament , being the only institution directly elected by the european citizens , should strive to have a greater say in all three of them .
we should not , however , accept an increase in parliamentary powers at one level at the expense of our existing powers at another level .
codecision is not negotiable .
parliament fought for many years to get it and it is now enshrined in the treaty .
i am pleased to hear the commissioner ’ s assurances on codecision here today .
may i say to the presidency that the difference with the dceci is that it seeks to replace 16 codecided regulations with one regulation .
i am absolutely amazed that the commission and council can so easily agree on taking away the role of parliament .
we should also not permit the human rights instrument , which parliament has consistently been calling for , to be used to make us relinquish our policy-setting powers .
human rights are too important to be used as a bargaining chip in interinstitutional negotiations .
priorities may change rapidly , according to our political agendas and those of our partners , but a procedural regulation will ensure that implementation can go on unhindered .
as rapporteur on the dceci , i am fully determined to continue the intensive work that has gone into it and to ensure that it is in place as a procedural regulation well before the end of the year .
both the geographical and the thematic content are close to the heart of the european parliament and require a thorough debate .
these require a full and proper debate in parliament .
this will speed up negotiations within parliament and with the other institutions once we have received formal proposals .
for that , we need a legal base .
it is up to the commission to propose it in time .
i welcome the tone and content of the commissioner ’ s contribution here today , but there is a lot of work to be done and i hope we will soon get down to doing it .
when the european commission presented its package in 2004 , one thing was uncontroversial and universally praised , and that was simplification .
simplification is a great virtue of the whole package presented in 2004 , as it makes it easier for parties from outside the eu to use our legal bases for external aid .
however , parliament clearly believes that this simplification cannot be implemented at the cost of restricting the political aims of our external aid , and neither can it be implemented at the cost of parliament ’ s monitoring powers .
this is why 124 amendments appeared in my report for the committee on foreign affairs .
we must remember that at the end of the year our current legal basis , in the form of meda and tacis , the main instruments of neighbourhood and partnership aid , will expire .
we should give our external partners as much time as possible to prepare for this enormous and important change with regard to the legal basis for the provision of external aid .
in the course of 18 months of parliamentary work , we have made significant progress .
we have introduced changes which will allow the neighbourhood policy to be applied to countries such as belarus which avoid cooperation with the european union .
in spite of what i would call the governmental character of the neighbourhood policy , we have increased the role of non-governmental organisations .
this instrument will be flexible enough to achieve our aims in a legally and politically hostile environment .
as we all know , we face such hostile situations fairly frequently .
of course , i am aware that any compromise is uneasy , as this one is for parliament .
i am sure that this compromise does not sit easily with any of us , but i am certain that the most important feeling here is that of satisfaction at having been able to reach an understanding .
i hardly need to add that our southern and eastern neighbours are eagerly awaiting the completion of our work .
once again , i would like to thank everyone who contributed to the completion of this work .
we were happy to go down this road hand in hand with the commission , even though this was not always characterised by complete harmony .
as i see it , there is a correlation between our increased activity in the sphere of foreign policy and the need for parliament to have a greater say .
i want to emphasise once more that europe ’ s 450 million citizens expect this democratic legitimacy , and expect it to be monitored .
we are now being given the chance to do these things , and we will certainly make use of it .
i just want to briefly review the points that were of particular concern to us , and on which we have now reached agreement .
thirdly , we have come to an agreement on matters of content .
we saw this as vitally important , and it will also be vitally important in terms of practical external policy , for example , our demand as regards the peacebuilding commission .
we have been able to reach agreement on landmines , on issues relating to women and children , on the conditionality of anti-terrorism measures , and on the revision clause .
we regard that as an important and fundamental precondition if the war on terror is to be steered in the right direction .
turning , if i may , to the coordination of peacebuilding , i will be discussing the proposal you made yesterday evening with the members who have up to now been actively working alongside me on this .
it may be unusual to do so at this hour of the day , but the debate we are having today is a debate on fundamental principles .
we are going for a final spurt in order to be able to vote on the stability instrument in june , at first reading .
. mr president , mr szent-iványi is the rapporteur on the instrument for pre-accession assistance , but he is not here , because the commissioner has sent him far away to oversee the elections in fiji .
mr szent-iványi sends his greetings and asks us on his behalf to thank the commissioner for her speech , which is in complete harmony with the agreement which has been reached on this issue .
a major reorganisation in the financing of external relations is to be introduced through the regulations now being discussed .
previous financial instruments are being combined and the decision-making process reformed .
the european neighbourhood and partnership instrument is to replace the current tacis and meda systems .
it will be a massive challenge to harmonise the administrative procedures and interlink them .
the pending implementing regulation must be drafted carefully and take parliament ’ s views on the matter into account .
for all the financial instruments we need a decision-making system that safeguards parliament ’ s influence even after the regulations are adopted .
the negotiations on this matter have gone very well indeed .
the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe is pleased that the other institutions have at last approved parliament ’ s call for establishing an instrument for human rights and democracy .
the external relations instruments form a whole , and consensus must be reached on all of its components between the council , the commission and parliament .
this will require flexibility on all sides , including the european parliament .
the changes to the financing mechanisms are so significant that problems can be expected in their practical application .
all the institutions must be ready to make changes , if necessary , to the regulations now being decided upon within the current financing period .
i was shadow rapporteur on behalf of the alde group when the enpi regulation was being discussed and i would like to thank my colleague , mr szymański , for his cooperation .
i am especially glad that the northern dimension and cooperation with our northern neighbours were also covered by the regulation .
– i would like to call upon my colleagues to consider their positions regarding the legal basis of the proposed regulation .
it is necessary to retain a dual legal system and thereby to ensure that the committee on foreign affairs will in future play a role in the processes of development and economic cooperation .
if article 179 provided the sole legal basis , this process would be exclusively in the hands of the committee for development , and our committee would lose its authority .
you have already spoken of human rights here , although these are in the afet portfolio .
i would also like to draw attention to the fact that i have been informed that a dual legal basis would undermine the authority of the european parliament .
if we have a single legal basis relying on article 179 alone there is a danger that programmes such as erasmus mondus or other educational programmes and student grants will disappear .
article 179 is not able to cover the broad spectrum of development and economic cooperation .
for example , it would not cover sectoral cooperation in areas such as transport and energy .
not all types of cooperation can be subsumed under the term ‘ development cooperation ’ .
furthermore , article 179 applies only to developing countries , and the eu does not have its own definition of developing countries , which it has borrowed from the oecd .
article 181a , on the other hand , speaks of third countries , which means its definition is less restrictive .
if article 181 were dropped , some countries would be automatically excluded .
. mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the subject of my speech is the european neighbourhood and partnership instrument , which i have followed as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on development .
this new policy , which became necessary after the last major enlargement , covers a vast geographical area .
the primary objective of this policy is , as you know , the creation of a common area of prosperity and security for developing economic integration and political cooperation between the union and its partner countries .
the neighbourhood and partnership instrument establishes a close relationship between internal and external cohesion : from that perspective , security is therefore linked to development .
i would therefore draw the commission 's and the council 's attention to the fact that development policy must have greater scope as an instrument of the union ’ s external relations .
the spokesmen who have spoken before me have said that we are still awaiting a genuine instrument , which the commission has said it will present , for strengthening human rights and support for democracy .
i would call upon the commission to bear this in mind and , when it comes to implementing this agreement with neighbouring countries , to remember that many of them are not democracies .
it must therefore bear very much in mind that this instrument cannot be allowed to strengthen non-democratic regimes and that it must therefore take very good account of these non-governmental actors .
i can do no other than stress – and in this i am expressing the employment committee ’ s view – how important it is that the social dimension be given greater emphasis in promoting the neighbourhood instrument .
i would like to take this opportunity to reiterate how important is the role played by the social partners in the neighbourhood instrument .
if there is to be partnership with these countries , then it is absolutely essential that their role be strengthened and promoted .
this house can count the implementation of educational measures and their social role as accompaniments to the action plans among its successes .
mr president , the committee on budgets was pleased to address the financial aspects of these issues .
we were glad that in the future our foreign policy and neighbourhood policy activities would be conducted within a more transparent and more simplified structure .
we have a saying : a bad neighbourhood is a turkish curse .
it originated in the times when a large part of hungary was under the occupation of the ottoman empire .
this will also be in the interest of our safety .
i ask the house to support the proposal , and i would like to thank everybody for their work .
mr president , relations between the old and newer neighbours play an important role in european union foreign policy .
in recent times , however , we have found out from the media that the financing of projects is in some cases quite unclear .
the status of legal entity submitted concerning partners is also missing .
the second observation concerns the introduction of the northern dimension into the draft from the same position .
the northern dimension is undoubtedly a most successful step by finland in relations between the european union and russia .
its extent has , however , not been defined .
from time to time it is presented as an immediate neighbourhood policy of the member states – that is , finland , estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland .
the third and best possibility is good-neighbourly relations between the eight member states from the baltic sea region and russia , which naturally does not rule out the involvement of other countries .
we cannot jointly fight crime or build border infrastructure if the funds allocated for this purpose sink in a mire of corruption or incompetence .
. mr president , commissioner , mr winkler , the european neighbourhood and partnership instrument simplifies the european union 's external aid and strengthens cooperation with our neighbours , and that is a good thing .
nevertheless , we must be prudent with regard to the funding we grant to the neighbourhood policy .
we need to bear in mind the differences between our neighbours to the east and those to the south , and the fact that reforms are being implemented at variable speeds .
let us ensure that european financial aid remains stable and , in particular , that it continues to be divided as at present .
i am thinking here of our neighbours in the mediterranean , who , as part of the barcelona process , have a particular relationship with the european union .
we need to show and prove that our partnership continues to be a high priority , by increasing our political , economic and cultural cooperation .
as mr szymański has already said , agreement on the european neighbourhood and partnership instrument at first reading is now within reach .
it is vitally important that we , in consultation with the council , have reached agreement on how we go about this .
specifically , we have managed to maintain the interreg method under regional policy .
finally , we have also reached agreement on the transitional regulation , which means that preparatory measures can now be funded .
a readily implementable euro-mediterranean partnership initiative ( empi ) will be before us from 2007 onwards .
in that connection , i would like to thank mr szymański and the council for their unyielding commitment to reach agreement .
my opinion is that this report is an opportunity to provide at all stages for the involvement of the european parliament in the control and management of the new ipa .
in that respect , consultation is not sufficient .
in fact , due to the budgetary and political character of the issues at stake , provision should be made for codecision procedures .
moreover , proper account should be taken of the specific situations and potential difficulties of the beneficiary countries .
alternative implementing arrangements should therefore be in force in order to avoid any shared management problems .
i am also pleased that the negotiations with the council made it possible to restrict the scope of the stability instrument by limiting cooperation in the fields of peacekeeping and anti-terrorist activities .
nevertheless , the commission 's proposal aiming to establish a non-compulsory call-back mechanism does not make up for the deficiencies in parliament 's power of codecision on the political content .
with regard to the mitchell report , i am delighted that parliament has not yielded to the commission or the council .
tomorrow , we are going to vote on a text that maintains parliament 's powers and allows it to retain its role as colegislator regarding the political direction to be taken by the new cooperation and development instrument .
there is no reason to yield because this power is an established right .
indeed , the political guidelines on which we want to secure codecision will replace 16 regulations that underwent the codecision procedure .
now that the initial battle has been fought , we expect the commission to propose a policy soon so that we can complete the second reading before the end of this year .
nevertheless , i am concerned about the neighbourhood instrument .
it raises the same problems as the development instrument , but the response provided is considerably different .
as in the case of the development cooperation and economic cooperation instrument ( dceci ) , this instrument is subject to the codecision procedure but has no political content .
as in the case of the dceci , the political content to be defined will , for 15 of the 17 countries covered by the neighbourhood instrument , replace around a dozen subject-related regulations subject to the codecision procedure .
we are an elected assembly and our work is , by definition , political .
we have chosen , though , to legislate on the most technical aspect of the partnership – the procedural framework – but to keep our peace on the political strategy .
today , we are prepared to give up the call-back mechanism and to yield to the commission and the council in order to adopt this text at first reading .
why should we go back on an established right ?
why should our legislative power be curtailed at a time when parliament is achieving significant legislative victories in other areas , such as port services , the services directive and , tomorrow , the dceci ?
i understand that we need to reach a speedy compromise on this instrument with the council and the commission , but how can any elected representative vote to lose his prerogatives ?
mr president , the facility to respond to threats against human rights and democracy is a self-evident and necessary objective .
. mr president , i fully support the objectives of the ‘ prodi package ’ of simplifying the structure of our external actions .
the committee on international trade has three main concerns about the packages in general and the dceci instrument in particular .
our second concern is the apparent downplaying of the importance of trade in the package as a whole .
we want trade-related assistance to be given a clearer focus and wonder , in the absence of a thematic programme , how trade will be handled in the proposed structures for the new instruments .
finally , we share the other committees ’ concerns about the erosion of parliamentary control and believe that parliament was right to reject the original 2004 proposals .
. mr president , firstly i would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr szymánski , on the enpi .
the european neighbourhood and partnership instrument – which will replace the existing tacis and meda programmes in 2007 – is , in my view , essential to budgetary discipline and procedure .
like russia , which is not part of the enp but enjoys the four common spaces , these are all key neighbouring countries whose geopolitical stability and economic prosperity is vital to eu interests .
we need to be surrounded by a ring of friends who enjoy free markets , security within their borders and shared values with the european union , particularly on human rights and democracy-building .
nevertheless , it is an important contribution in technical assistance and investment in key infrastructure projects , which can complement the work of the eib and the ebrd .
the enpi must remain part of the codecision procedure under article 179 , with suitable monitoring and oversight by our parliament .
. – mr president , there is disquiet within the committee on development at the difficulties that have arisen with the european commission and the council with regard to the negotiation of the instrument for development cooperation .
nevertheless , those promises have not been fulfilled , despite some effort and progress , and they have not been reflected in any text presented to parliament by the commission .
there were three main problems with what has been proposed to us .
firstly , it did not appear reasonable to have a single instrument for development cooperation and cooperation with the developed world .
we were concerned that resources intended for the development of the countries of the south could be transferred to cooperation with the countries of the north .
with regard to this point , the council and the commission appeared to sympathise with our position .
the second point was more serious .
we could not accept the idea of parliament losing competences that it had had with regard to the seventeen instruments which were now intended to be compacted into one or two .
the entire process of european integration has been characterised by a constant effort to consolidate the democratic progress made within the interinstitutional relationship , which has essentially taken the form of greater competences for parliament in decision-making .
we are surprised , and somewhat indignant , at the approach advocated by the commission , which sets efficiency against democracy .
the intention has been to reduce parliament ’ s competences , on the grounds that they complicate the process and make it less efficient .
it is not the hierarchy of the committee on development that is at stake , but rather the competence of parliament , and in that regard we cannot take a single step backwards .
in this respect , there has not been the least progress that can be objectively measured .
some of them may appear appropriate ; what is unacceptable is that they should be funded with resources earmarked for development cooperation .
for example , funding the repatriation of illegal immigrants from the instrument for development cooperation is not acceptable to us .
these programmes require a differentiated instrument funded from other sources .
in this area as well , there has been some progress in our debate with the commission and the council .
. – mr president , there is indeed consensus in this house on the need for reform of the development cooperation instruments , and that it needs to happen without delay .
in this field , there are already 16 different regulations , with differing priorities and running for different periods of time .
the existing procedure is complex , incomprehensible and opaque .
the commission ’ s draft , though , is a model of how not to tackle this state of affairs .
what i have heard from you today , commissioner , amounts – putting it cautiously – to contradictory statements on these three core issues .
we want parliament to vote right now , so that there can be no speculation about it being parliament that delayed the agreement .
it is on that basis that we need to negotiate .
interinstitutional cooperation and dialogue constitute a testing ground that will enable us to achieve a positive and effective outcome in the interest of all the actors involved , particularly those from developing countries .
as regards the development cooperation instrument , significant progress has been made on the expiry date , on the revision clause and on other topics too .
the negotiation process has succeeded in overcoming the differences .
a solution , which we consider positive , has been found on one of the decisive points of the mitchell report , namely that of keeping cooperation with developing countries and with industrial countries separate .
they have no intention of creating , as the constitution proposes , a minister for foreign affairs , not even if it is mr solana , and they have even less intention of giving him services and funding .
we will certainly vote against these funds and this financial perspective , which is a fatal perspective for europe and its dignity .
. madam president , i should like to congratulate my colleague , mr mitchell , for the work that he has done on this report .
there are a number of points that i wish to make today .
i believe that it is imperative for parliament to retain the power of codecision on strategic priorities , geographical and thematic aid programmes .
it must also apply for the multiannual financial framework .
it is essential that we do not allow the european commission to introduce a single instrument in such matters .
i believe that , in keeping with the millennium development goals , the scope of eu development aid should be restricted to the developing countries only .
on the question of aid funding , i believe that the budget support must be approved by the court of auditors and the parliament of the partner country .
the eu is the world ’ s biggest aid donor and is responsible for 55 % of all development aid .
unfortunately , much of that aid is of very little use to developing countries unless we also make trade work for them .
i propose a significant boost in aid for trade , which would be aimed at helping developing countries help themselves by enabling them to turn market opportunities into reality .
i believe it is vital that the european parliament does not lose its joint legislative power with the council on the issue of development policy .
what is important is that these documents create a direct link between crisis aid , european union development cooperation and the implementation of human rights policy .
the objective of establishing mutual additionality between the aid channelled through the stabilisation instrument and the aid provided in the framework of the three remaining foreign instruments is also worthy of recognition .
thus we have an opportunity to create an integrated european union strategic programme connecting the main policy instruments with the elements of the new stabilisation instrument .
i am pleased that the council and now the commission have supported the committee on foreign affairs ’ request for a separate ‘ human rights and democracy instrument ’ .
with the perspective of implementing this instrument , there arises an opportunity for agreements to be concluded concerning the remaining three foreign policy instruments .
today ’ s message is that the european parliament has established the objective of considerably increasing its right of participation in the issues mentioned .
we also now expect the commission to offer legislative initiatives for realising the foreign aid instruments in question .
the implementation of these instruments concerning all third countries , and on the same criteria is , however , a much more difficult question .
to that end , it is of the utmost necessity that the european union ’ s integral foreign and security policy should be implemented in practice , not only in theory .
this policy must be coordinated more firmly and effectively in order for it to create the necessary generally established framework for reacting to crisis situations .
what parliament wants is a say in how policy is fleshed out in terms of topics and geography and in the distribution of funds across the priorities .
although we feel we have now , for lack of new proposals from the commission , wasted 18 months , all is not lost .
secondly , we would like to see separate proposals for programmes arranged according to topic and geography .
we are prepared to restrict the number of regulations .
we want the right of codecision on the broad outlines of policy .
thirdly , we want financial priorities either on the basis of a multi-annual financial framework or by including a very low percentage in the geographical and thematic proposals .
i would urge the council and the commission , in order that poverty may be reduced in a credible and effective way , to accept our offer .
i would thank the austrian presidency for the commitment it has shown to date in this respect .
madam president , with its various financial instruments , is the eu providing itself with the means to pursue its external policies sincerely and in full ?
if europe disappoints , euroscepticism will increase .
if we disappoint our partners , we are taking the risk that they will turn away from us .
i hope that the neighbourhood instrument will be effective and will bring the regional stability for which we hope .
in bringing the countries of the southern caucasus into the neighbourhood policy , for example , has the union taken account of the expectations of the people concerned ?
i am talking about a sub-region that i know well .
bordered by russia , turkey and iran , it is now at the centre of european and international debate .
by guaranteeing their security , we are also guaranteeing our own .
these countries have voluntarily turned towards our european values , and they must be supported in their action plans .
resumption of the session
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of the sitting on thursday , 21 september have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
madam president , i shall keep to the subject of the minutes .
that is almost a personal record for me this autumn !
yes indeed , mrs thors , we shall amend the minutes accordingly .
( the minutes were approved )
presidency communication on the situation in the middle east
the city bears the weight of powerful symbols for all three monotheistic religions .
this is absolutely disproportionate and in no way helps the peace process .
this would not do justice to the matter .
we have not yet moved on to the discussion of the agenda .
i did receive the request you sent me .
i am very grateful to you for raising this subject .
my group fully supports the substance of what you have said .
thank you , mr sterckx , we take note of your statement .
however , a decision was made , and we must respect this .
i shall of course do so , mr davies .
i think i am correct in saying that .
there are not , therefore , any amendments to the agenda for friday .
this is a lie : the accounts have been fiddled .
so roll on the adoption of the knörr borràs report !
the work carried out by parliament and the council has been enormously useful .
we believe that the game of clarity should apply on both sides .
otherwise , we would not be serving the objective of the regulation .
more support is needed for growth .
investing in new business start - ups will also create jobs .
this is of vital importance for a variety of reasons .
subject to rules of prudence , institutions must have complete freedom of investment .
but the availability of capital is not the only threshold .
mr president , the skinner report is to be welcomed .
an entrepreneurial europe needs rewards and opportunities which benefit everyone .
so we must fully support the demands that have been made .
experience suggests the opposite .
thank you very much , mr solbes .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m .
the process is based on a relationship of equality .
it is important to fill the cultural vacuum between our two regions .
the asia - europe foundation has contributed considerably to this objective .
this proposal originates from the organisers of the forum of the peoples .
this is something else that can be achieved through the asem process .
all matters of this kind should very definitely be raised .
much of this stability does not exist in the region at this time .
the korean peninsula is a source of continuing strategic instability .
the rebuilding of east timor is still an ongoing process .
another missed opportunity .
we will consider any additional interparliamentary relations to be enormously positive .
surely the moluccas cannot be overlooked in the asem negotiations .
parliament is in agreement with this .
whatever we agree tomorrow will ultimately have to go into the conciliation procedure .
port policy would then mainly focus on offering support to peripheral regions .
other large ports too are striving for growth and dominance .
the emphasis is on routes between different member states .
the transport situations within the different member states are far from identical .
that cannot be in our interest .
mr president , i would like to thank mr piecyk for his work .
this is therefore , to a certain extent , an unnecessary debate .
giving industry some space to catch up seems justified in my opinion .
stinginess pays off .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
however , we did not set a deadline for tabling motions for resolutions .
i will now put this request to the vote .
i have heard no mention of these this morning .
i support the enlargement of the european union .
however , eu member state governments face difficult choices .
that is what the charter stipulates .
let us not violate it before it is even applied .
here are just a few of the many avenues which could be explored .
we need , for example , to agree to and facilitate subsidiarity .
expectations prior to the meeting in biarritz are running high .
europe is in danger of being defeated by compromises , not crises .
when such crises are triggered by opposing views they are healthy .
the problem may well be a general one .
the charter should become a live instrument , both legally and politically .
this is also clear from article 50 of the treaty .
the danish ' no ' vote is not isolationist or nationalistic in character .
in other words , the french presidency 's task is no easy one .
in this way they will gradually become de facto legally binding legal norms .
the majority of the european parliament has never supported this view .
it is time , instead , to intensify this function .
the second slight difference concerns the euro .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
bodrato recommendations ( a5 - 0263 and 0262 / 2000 )
piecyk recommendation for second reading ( a5 - 0232 / 2000 )
hatzidakis report ( a5 - 0231 / 2000 )
that is the main reason why i intend to reject the proposals .
skinner report ( a5 - 0235 / 2000 )
to risk personal capital , in particular , is a highly precarious business .
. i welcome this excellent report from my colleague mr skinner .
it is an accurate reflection of the liberal europe which is being built .
this is why i did not vote in favour of this draft charter .
a striking example is workers ' rights .
pending further clarification , we therefore abstain from the vote .
enlargement is a historic undertaking .
moreover , the statistics are getting worse , not better .
we must show they are wrong .
